Now beside their ships the other great men of the Achaians
slept night long, with the soft bondage of slumber upon them;
but the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,
was held by no sweet sleep as he pondered deeply within him.
As when the lord of Hera the lovely-haired flashes his lightning
as he brings on a great rainstorm, or a hail incessant,
or a blizzard, at such time when the snowfall scatters on ploughlands,
or drives on somewhere on earth the huge edge of tearing battle,
such was Agamemnon, with the beating turmoil in his bosom
from the deep heart, and all his wits were shaken within him.
Now he would gaze across the plain to the Trojan camp, wondering
at the number of their fires that were burning in front of Ilion,
toward the high calls of their flutes and pipes, the murmur of people.
Now as he would look again to the ships and the Achaian
people, he would drag the hair by its roots from his head, looking
toward Zeus on high, and his proud heart was stricken with lamentation.
Now to his mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,
first among men to seek out Nestor, the son of Neleus,
to see if Nestor with him could work out a plan that would not fail,
and one that might drive the evil away from all the Danaans.
He stood upright, and slipped the tunic upon his body,
and underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals,
and thereafter slung across him the tawny hide of a lion
glowing and huge, that swung to his feet, and took up a spear.
So likewise trembling seized Menelaos, neither on his eyes
had sweet slumber descending settled, for fear that the Argives
might suffer some hurt, they who for his sake over much water
had come to Troy, bearing their bold attack to the Trojans.
First of all he mantled his broad back in a leopard's
spotted hide, then lifting the circle of a brazen helmet
placed it upon his head, and took up a spear in his big hand,
and went on his way to waken his brother, who was the great king
of all Argives, one honoured in his own land as a god is.
He found him putting the splendid armour about his shoulders
beside the stern of his ship, and was welcomed as he came up to him.
It was Menelaos of the great war cry who spoke first:
