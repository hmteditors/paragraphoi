So he spoke, and strode on through the ditch, and there followed with him
the kings of the Argives, all who had been called into conclave,
and with them went Meriones and Nestor's glorious

After they had crossed the deep-dug ditch they settled
on clean ground, where there showed a space not cumbered with corpses
of the fallen, a place whence Hektor the huge had turned back

or he might overhear some thing that the Trojans are saying,
what they deliberate among themselves, and whether they purpose
to stay where they are, close to the ships, or else to withdraw back
into their city, now that they have beaten the Achaians.

among all people, and an excellent gift would befall him;
for all those who hold by the ships high power as princes,

one that will be forever by at the feasts and festivals.'
