'Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,
pick your man to be your companion, whichever you wish,
the best of all who have shown, since many are eager to do it.
You must not, for the awe that you feel in your heart, pass over
the better man and take the worse, giving way to modesty
and looking to his degree--not even if he be kinglier.'
