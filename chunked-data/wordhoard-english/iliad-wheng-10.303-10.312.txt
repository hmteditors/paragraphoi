'Who would take upon him this work and bring it to fulfilment
for a huge price? The reward will be one that will suffice him;
for I will give a chariot and two strong-necked horses
who are the finest of all beside the fast ships of the Achaians
to him who has the daring, winning honour for himself also,
to go close to the swift-running ships and find out for us
whether the swift ships are guarded, as they were before this,
or whether now the Achaians who are beaten under our hands
are planning flight among themselves, and no longer are willing
to guard them by night, now that stark weariness has broken them.'
