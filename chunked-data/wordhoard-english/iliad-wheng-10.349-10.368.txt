So they spoke, and bent aside from their way, through the corpses,
while he in the thoughtlessness of his heart ran swiftly by them.
But when he was gone from them as far as the range of a plough yoke
of mules, since these are better beasts than oxen for dragging
the wrought ploughshare through the depth of the harvest land, these two
ran after him, and he heard the thudding of their feet and stopped still.
He thought in his heart these would be friends from among the Trojans
to turn him back, and that Hektor had sped them to summon him again.
But when they got to a spear's throw from him, or less even,
he saw that these were enemy men, and moved his knees rapidly
to run away, and these set out in rapid chase of him.
And, as when two rip-fanged hounds have sighted a wild beast,
a young deer, or a hare, and go after it, eagerly always
through the spaces of the woods, and the chase runs crying before them,
so the son of Tydeus, and Odysseus, sacker of cities,
kept always hard on his heels and cut him off from his people.
But when he was on the point of reaching the Achaian pickets,
as he fled toward the vessels, then Athene put great power
in Tydeus' son, so that no other bronze-armoured Achaian
might win the glory of striking him down, and he come in second.
