'Hektor has led my mind astray with many deceptions.
He promised me the single-foot horses of proud Achilleus,
Peleus' son, and the chariot bright with bronze, for my gift,
and gave me an order, to go through the running black night,
and get close to the enemy men, and find out for him
whether the swift ships are guarded, as they were before this,
or whether now the Achaians who are broken under our hands
are planning flight among themselves, and no longer are willing
to guard them by night, now that stark weariness has broken them.'
Then Odysseus the resourceful smiled and spoke to him:
'Surely now, these were mighty gifts that your heart longed after,
the horses of valiant Aiakides. They are difficult horses
for mortal men to manage, or even to ride behind them
for all except Achilleus, who was born of an immortal mother.
But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately.
Where did you leave Hektor, the people's shepherd, when you came here?
Where is his gear of war lying? Where are his horses?
How are the rest of the Trojans disposed, the guards and the sleepers?
What do they deliberate among themselves? Do they purpose
to stay where they are, close to the ships? Or else to withdraw back
into the city, now that they have beaten the Achaians?'
