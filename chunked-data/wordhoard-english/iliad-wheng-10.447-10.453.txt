'Do not, Dolon, have in your mind any thought of escape
now you have got in our hands, though you brought us an excellent message.
For if we let you get away now, or set you free, later
you will come back again to the fast ships of the Achaians
either to spy on us once more, or to fight strongly with us.
But if, beaten down under my hands, you lose your life now,
then you will nevermore be an affliction upon the Argives.'
