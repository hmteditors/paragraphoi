'Take us alive, son of Atreus, and take appropriate ransom.
In the house of Antimachos the treasures lie piled in abundance,
bronze is there, and gold, and difficultly wrought iron,
and our father would make you glad with abundant repayment
were he to hear we were alive by the ships of the Achaians.'
