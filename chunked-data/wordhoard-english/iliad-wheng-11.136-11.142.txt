Thus these two cried out upon the king, lamenting
and in pitiful phrase, but they heard the voice that was without pity:
'If in truth you are the sons of wise Antimachos,
that man who once among the Trojans assembled advised them
that Menelaos, who came as envoy with godlike Odysseus,
should be murdered on the spot nor let go back to the Achaians,
so now your mutilation shall punish the shame of your father.'
