As when obliterating fire comes down on the timbered forest
and the roll of the wind carries it everywhere, and bushes
leaning under the force of the fire's rush tumble uprooted,
so before Atreus' son Agamemnon went down the high heads
of the running Trojans, and in many places the strong-necked horses
rattled their empty chariots along the causeways of battle,
and longed for their haughty charioteers, who were lying
along the ground, to delight no longer their wives, but the vultures.
But Zeus drew Hektor out from under the dust and the missiles,
out of the place where men were killed, the blood and confusion,
while Atreides followed urging the Danaans forever onward.
The Trojans swept in their flight past the barrow of ancient Ilos
Dardanos' son, to the centre of the level ground and the fig tree,
as they made for the city, and he followed them always, screaming,

But when they had made their way to the Skaian gates and the oak tree
the Trojans stood their ground, and each side endured the other,
while others still in the middle plain stampeded like cattle
when a lion, coming upon them in the dim night, has terrified
the whole herd, while for a single one sheer death is emerging.

under the hands of Atreides who raged with his spear in the forefront.
But when he was on the point of making his way to the city
and the steep wall, the father of gods and of men descending
out of the sky took his place along the ridges of Ida
of the fountains, and held fast in his hands the thunderbolt.
He sent on her way Iris of the golden wings with a message:
