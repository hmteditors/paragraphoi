'Sokos, son of wise Hippasos the breaker of horses,
death was too quick for you and ran you down, you could not
avoid it. Wretch, since now your father and your honoured mother
will not be able to close your eyes in death, but the tearing
birds will get you, with their wings close-beating about you.
If I die, the brilliant Achaians will bury me in honour.'
