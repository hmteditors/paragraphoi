'Son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, Aias, lord of the people,
the war cry of patient Odysseus is ringing about me
with a sound as if he had been cut off by himself, and the Trojans
were handling him violently in the strong encounter. Therefore
let us go to him through the battle. It is better to defend him against them.
I fear that, caught alone, he may be hurt by the Trojans
brave as he is, and so a great loss may befall the Danaans.'
