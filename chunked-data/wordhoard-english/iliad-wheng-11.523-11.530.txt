'Hektor, you and I encounter the Danaans at the utmost
edge of the sorrowful battle, but meanwhile the rest of the Trojans
are driven pell-mell upon each other, the men and their horses.
The Telamonian Aias drives them; I know him surely
for he carries the broad shield on his shoulders. So, let us also
steer our horses and chariot that way, since there the horsemen
and the foot-ranks more than elsewhere hurling the wicked war-hate
against each other, are destroying, and the ceaseless clamour has risen.'
