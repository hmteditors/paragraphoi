'Son of Menoitios, you who delight my heart, o great one,
now I think the Achaians will come to my knees and stay there
in supplication, for a need past endurance has come to them.
But go now, Patroklos beloved of Zeus, to Nestor
and ask him who is this wounded man he brings in from the fighting.
Indeed, seeing him from behind I thought he was like Machaon,
Asklepios' son, in all ways, but I got no sight of the man's face
since the horses were tearing forward and swept on by me.'
