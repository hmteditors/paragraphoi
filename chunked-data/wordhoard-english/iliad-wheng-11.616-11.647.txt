So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion
and went on the run along the shelters and ships of the Achaians.
Now when the others came to the shelter of the son of Neleus,
they themselves dismounted to the prospering earth, and the henchman
Eurymedon unharnessed the horses of the old man
from the chariot. The men wiped off the sweat on their tunics
and stood to the wind beside the beach of the sea, and thereafter
went inside the shelter and took their places on settles.
And lovely-haired Hekamede made them a potion, she whom
the old man won from Tenedos, when Achilleus stormed it.
She was the daughter of great-hearted Arsino√∂s. The Achaians
chose her out for Nestor, because he was best of them all in counsel.
First she pushed up the table in front of them, a lovely
table, polished and with feet of cobalt, and on it
she laid a bronze basket, with onion to go with the drinking,
and pale honey, and beside it bread, blessed pride of the barley,
and beside it a beautifully wrought cup which the old man brought with him
from home. It was set with golden nails, the eared handles upon it
were four, and on either side there were fashioned two doves
of gold, feeding, and there were double bases beneath it.

with Pramneian wine, and grated goat's-milk cheese into it
with a bronze grater, and scattered with her hand white barley into it.
When she had got the potion ready, she told them to drink it,
and both when they had drunk it were rid of their thirst's parching
and began to take pleasure in conversation, talking with each other,
and Patroklos came and stood, a godlike man, in the doorway.
Seeing him the old man started up from his shining
chair, and took him by the hand, led him in and told him to sit down,
but Patroklos from the other side declined, and spoke to him:
