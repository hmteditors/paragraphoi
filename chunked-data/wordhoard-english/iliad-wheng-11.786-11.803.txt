"My child, by right of blood Achilleus is higher than you are,
but you are the elder. Yet in strength he is far the greater.
You must speak solid words to him, and give him good counsel,
and point his way. If he listens to you it will be for his own good."
This is what the old man told you, you have forgotten. Yet even
now you might speak to wise Achilleus, he might be persuaded.
Who knows if, with God helping, you might trouble his spirit
by entreaty, since the persuasion of a friend is a strong thing.
But if he is drawing back from some prophecy known in his own heart
and by Zeus' will his honoured mother has told him of something,
let him send you out, at least, and the rest of the Myrmidon people
follow you, and you may be a light given to the Danaans.
And let him give you his splendid armour to wear to the fighting,
if perhaps the Trojans might think you are he, and give way
from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind
again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting.
You, unwearied, might with a mere cry pile men wearied
back upon their city, and away from the ships and the shelters.'
