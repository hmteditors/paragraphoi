'Go on the run, brilliant Tho√∂tes, and call Aias here,
or better, both Aiantes, since that would be far the best thing
that could happen, since here headlong destruction is building against us.
Such is the weight of the Lykian lords upon us, who even
before now have shown as deadly men in the strong encounters.
But if in their place also hard work and fury have arisen,
at least let powerful Telamonian Aias come by himself,
and let Teukros follow with him, with his craft in the bow's use.'
