'Aiantes, leaders of the bronze-armoured Argives: Menestheus,
beloved son of Peteos engendered of Zeus, desires you
to go where he is and meet the danger, if only for a little;
both of you for choice, since that would be far the best thing
that could happen, since there headlong destruction is building against him.
Such is the weight of the Lykian lords upon him, who even
before now have shown as deadly men in the strong encounters.
But if in this place also hard fighting and fury have arisen,
at least let powerful Telamonian Aias come by himself
and let Teukros follow with him, with his craft in the bow's use.'
