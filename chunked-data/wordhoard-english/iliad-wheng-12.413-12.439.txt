So he spoke, and they, awed at the reproach of their leader,
put on the pressure of more weight around their lord of the counsels.
And on the other side the Argives stiffened their battalions

from the rampart, once they had won to a place close under it;
but as two men with measuring ropes in their hands fight bitterly
about a boundary line at the meeting place of two cornfields,
and the two of them fight in the strait place over the rights of division,
so the battlements held these armies apart, and across them
they hewed at each other, and at the ox-hide shields strong-circled
guarding men's chests, and at the fluttering straps of the guard-skins.

but held evenly as the scales which a careful widow
holds, taking it by the balance beam, and weighs her wool evenly
at either end, working to win a pitiful wage for her children:
