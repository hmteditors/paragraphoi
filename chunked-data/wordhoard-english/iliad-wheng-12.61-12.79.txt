'Hektor, and other lords of the Trojans and companions in battle,
we are senseless trying to drive our fast-footed horses over
this ditch. It is hard indeed to cross, and sharp stakes are planted
inside it, and across from these the wall of the Achaians.
There there is no way to get down, no way again to do battle
from horses, for the passage is narrow and I think they must be hurt there.
For now if Zeus who thunders on high in evil intention
toward these is destroying them utterly, sending aid to the Trojans,
this is the way I would wish it, may it happen immediately
that the Achaians be destroyed here forgotten and far from
Argos; but if they turn again and a backrush comes on us
out of the ships, and we are driven against the deep ditch,
then I think no longer could one man to carry a message
get clear to the city, once the Achaians have turned back upon us.
Come then, do as I say, let us all be persuaded; let us
tell our henchmen to check our horses here by the ditch, then
let ourselves, all of us dismounted and armed in our war gear,
follow Hektor in mass formation. As for the Achaians,
they will not hold, if the bonds of death are fastened upon them.'
