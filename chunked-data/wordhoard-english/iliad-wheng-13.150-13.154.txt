'Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,
stand with me. The Achaians will not hold me back for a long time
for all they are building themselves into a bastion against me.
No, I think they will give back under my spear, if truly
I am driven by the greatest of gods, the thunderous lord of Hera.'
