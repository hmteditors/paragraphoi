'Idomeneus, may that man who this day wilfully hangs back
from the fighting never win home again out of Troy land,
but stay here and be made dogs' delight for their feasting. Come then,
take up your armour and go with me. We must speed this action
together, since we, being two, might bring some advantage.
The warcraft even of sad fighters combined turns courage,
and you and I would have skill to fight even against good men.'
