'There are others beside us to defend the ships in the centre,
the two Aiantes, and Teukros, best of all the Achaians
in archery, and a good man in the close of standing combat.
They can give Hektor, Priam's son, enough hard hitting,
even though he is very strong, and sweeps hard into battle.
Furious though he is for fighting, it will be very steep work
for him to win through their irresistible hands and their war strength
and fire the ships, unless the son of Kronos in person
should hurl the blazing firebrand into our fast-running vessels.
Nor would huge Telamonian Aias give way to any man,
one who was mortal and ate bread, the yield of Demeter,
one who could be broken by the bronze and great stones flung at him.
He would not make way for Achilleus who breaks men in battle,
in close combat. For speed of feet none can strive with Achilleus.
Hold, as you say, for the left of the army, and thus soonest
shall we see whether we win glory or give it to others.'
