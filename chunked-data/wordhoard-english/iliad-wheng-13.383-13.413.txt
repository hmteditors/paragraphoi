The hero Idomeneus spoke and dragged him through the strong encounter
caught by the foot, but now Asios came to stand by him
dismounted, ahead of his horses whom his henchman held ever behind him
so that they breathed on his shoulders. He was striving in all his fury
to strike Idomeneus, but he, too quick with a spearcast,
struck him in the gorge underneath the chin, and drove the bronze clean through.
He fell, as when an oak goes down or a white poplar
or like a towering pine tree which in the mountains the carpenters
have hewn down with their whetted axes to make a ship timber.
So he lay there felled in front of his horses and chariot,
roaring, and clawed with his hands at the bloody dust. Meanwhile
the charioteer who was close behind him was stricken in the wits
and shrinking from the hands of the enemy did not have daring
to turn the horses about, but Antilochos stubborn in battle
pinned him through the middle with a spearstroke, and the corselet
of bronze he wore could not hold, the spear fixed in the middle belly,
so that he tumbled, gasping, out of the strong-wrought chariot.
But for the horses, Antilochos, son of great-hearted Nestor,
drove them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians.
Deïphobos in sorrow for Asios now came close
in on Idomeneus, and with the bright spear made a cast at him,
but Idomeneus with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear
since also he was hidden beneath his shield's perfect circle, that shield
he carried, hooped in circles of glaring bronze, and the skins
of oxen, fitted with double cross-stays. He was all gathered
together under this, and the brazen spear shot over him
and the shield gave out a hollow clash as the spear glanced from it.
Yet Deïphobos made no utterly vain cast from his strong hand,
but struck Hypsenor, son of Hippasos, shepherd of the people,
in the liver under the midriff, and at once took the strength from his knees.
And Deïphobos vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:
