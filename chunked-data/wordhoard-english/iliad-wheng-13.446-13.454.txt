'De√Øphobos, are we then to call this a worthy bargain,
three men killed for one? It was you yourself were so boastful.
Strange man. Do you rather come yourself and stand up against me
so you can see what I am like, Zeus' seed, come here to face you.
Since Zeus first got by Krete Minos, who cared for his people,
and to Minos in turn was born a blameless son, Deukalion,
and Deukalion sired me to be lord over many people
in wide Krete, and now my ships have brought me to this place
to be an evil for you and your father and the rest of the Trojans.'
