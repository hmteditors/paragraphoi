'Aineias, lord of the Trojans' counsels, now there is need of you
to stand by your brother-in-law, if this bond of kinship touches you.
Come then, stand by Alkatho√∂s, who was your sister's husband
and in time past nursed you in his house when you were still little.
But now Idomeneus the spear-famed has killed him in battle.'
