'Aiantes, you two, remembering the spirit of warcraft
and not that of shivering panic, must save the Achaian people.
Elsewhere in truth I do not fear the Trojans' invincible
hands, though in full force they have swarmed over our great wall;
since the strong-greaved Achaians will be able to hold the rest of them.
But I fear most terribly disaster to us in the one place
where that berserk flamelike leads them against us, Hektor,
who claims he must be son of Zeus of the high strength. May this
be the message some one of the gods gives your minds to carry,
that you stand fast strongly yourselves, urge the rest to stand also.
Thus, hard though he sweeps on, you might stay him beside the fast-running
ships, even though the very Olympian wakes him to battle.'
