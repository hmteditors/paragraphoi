'This way, friends, stand by me, I am alone, and terribly
I fear the attack of swift-footed Aineias advancing upon me,
powerful as he is for the slaying of men in battle.
Likewise the flower of youth is his, where man's strength is highest,
since were we two of the same age, and in this same spirit,
soon he would win me in a great battle, or I would win him.'
