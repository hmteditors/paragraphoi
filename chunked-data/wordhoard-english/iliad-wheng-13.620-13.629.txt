'So, I think, shall you leave the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans,
you haughty Trojans, never to be glutted with the grim war noises,
nor go short of all that other shame and defilement
wherewith you defiled me, wretched dogs, and your hearts knew no fear
at all of the hard anger of Zeus loud-thundering,
the guest's god, who some day will utterly sack your steep city.
You who in vanity went away taking with you my wedded
wife, and many possessions, when she had received you in kindness.
And now once more you rage among our seafaring vessels
to throw deadly fire on them and kill the fighting Achaians.
