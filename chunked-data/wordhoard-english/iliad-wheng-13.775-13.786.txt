'Hektor, since it is your pleasure to blame me when I am blameless,
it would be better some other time to withdraw from the fighting
than now. My mother bore me not utterly lacking in warcraft.
For since that time when by the ships you wakened the battle
of our companions, we have stayed here and fought the Danaans
without end. And our companions are killed you ask for.
Only De√Øphobos and the strength of the prince Helenos
have gone away, wounded each in the hand by strokes
of the long spears, but the son of Kronos fended death from them.
Now lead on, wherever your heart and spirit command you,
and we shall follow you eagerly; I think that we shall not
come short in warcraft, in so far as the strength stays with us.
