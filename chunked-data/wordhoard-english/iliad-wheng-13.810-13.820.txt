'Man, you are mad. Come closer. Why try this way to terrify
the Argives? It is not that we are so unskilled in fighting,
but by the wicked whiplash of Zeus we Achaians are beaten.
I suppose, then, your heart is hopeful utterly to break up
our ships? We too have prompt hands among us strong to defend them.
Rather, far before this your own strong-founded citadel
must go down under our hands, stormed and utterly taken.
And for yourself I say that the time is close, when in flight
you will pray to Zeus father and the other immortals
that your bright-maned horses might be swifter than hawks are
as they carry you through the stirred dust of the plain to your city.'
