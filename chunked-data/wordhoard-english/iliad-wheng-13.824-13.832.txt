'Aias, you inarticulate ox, what is this you have spoken?
If I could only be called son to Zeus of the aegis
all the days of my life, and the lady Hera my mother,
and I be honoured, as Apollo and Athene are honoured,
so surely as this is a day that brings evil to the Argives,
all, and you will be killed with the rest of them, if you have daring
to stand up against my long spear, which will bite your delicate
body; yet then you will glut the dogs and birds of the Trojans
with fat and flesh, struck down beside the ships of the Achaians.'
