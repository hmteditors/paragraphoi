'Shame, you Argives, young fighting men, since I for my part
have confidence that by fighting you can save our ships from destruction;
but if you yourselves are to go slack from the sorrowful fighting
now is seen your day to be beaten down by the Trojans.
Oh for shame! Here is a great strange thing I see with my own eyes,
a terrible thing, and one that I thought never could happen,
that the Trojans could come against our ships, they who in time past
were like fugitive deer before us, who in the forests
are spoil for scavengers and wolves and leopards, who scatter
in absolute cowardice, there is no war spirit within them.
So before now the Trojans were unwilling to stand up
against the strength and hands of the Achaians, even for a little,
but now far from their city they fight by the hollow vessels
through the weakness of our leader, and the hanging back of our people
who have made their quarrel with him, and will not stand in defence
of the fast-running ships. Instead of this they are killed against them.
Yet even though it be utterly true that the son of Atreus
the hero wide-powerful Agamemnon is guilty
because he did dishonour to Peleus' son, the swift-footed,
still there is no way for us now to hang back from the fighting.
No, sooner let us heal it, for the hearts of great men can be healed.
But you can no longer in honour give way from your fighting valour
being all the best men along the host. Even I, for my part,
would not quarrel with any man who hung back from the fighting
because he was a weak thing, but with you my heart must be angry.
O friends, soon you will bring to pass some still greater evil
with this hanging back. Let every one of you plant in his heart's depth
discipline and shamefastness. A big battle rises against you.
For Hektor of the great war cry is fighting beside our vessels
in his power, and has broken our gates and the long door-bar.'
