'That man is here, we shall not look far for him, if you are willing
to listen, and not be each astonished in anger against me
because by birth I am the youngest among you. I also
can boast that my generation is of an excellent father,
Tydeus, whom now the heaped earth covers over in Thebe.
For there were three blameless sons who were born to Portheus,
and their home was in Pleuron and headlong Kalydon. Agrios
was first, then Melas, and the third was Oineus the horseman,
the father of my father, and in valour beyond the others.
But Oineus stayed in the land, while my father was driven and settled
in Argos. Such was the will of Zeus and the other immortals.
He married one of the daughters of Adrestos, and established
a house rich in substance, and plenty of wheat-grown acres
were his, with many orchards of fruit trees circled about him,
and many herds were his. He surpassed all other Achaians
with the spear. If all this is true, you must have heard of it.
Therefore you could not, saying that I was base and unwarlike
by birth, dishonour any word that I speak, if I speak well.
Let us go back to the fighting wounded as we are. We have to.
Once there, we must hold ourselves out of the onfall, clear of
missiles, so that none will add to the wound he has got already,
but we shall be there to drive them on, since even before this
they have favoured their anger, and stood far off, and will not fight for us.'
