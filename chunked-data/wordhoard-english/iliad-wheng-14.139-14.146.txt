must be happy as he stares at the slaughter of the Achaians
and their defeat. There is no heart in him, not even a little.
Even so may the god strike him down, let him go to destruction.

There will still be a time when the lords of Troy and their counsellors
shall send dust wide on the plain, and you yourself shall look on them
as they take flight for their city away from the ships and the shelters.'
