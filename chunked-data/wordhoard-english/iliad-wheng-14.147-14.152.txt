So he spoke, and swept on over the plain, with a huge cry
like the yell nine thousand men send up, or ten thousand
in battle, as they close in the hateful strife of the war god.

from his lungs, and in the heart of every Achaian implanted
great strength, to carry the battle on, and fight without flinching.
