'Sleep, why do you ponder this in your heart, and hesitate?
Or do you think that Zeus of the wide brows, aiding the Trojans,
will be angry as he was angry for his son, Herakles?
Come now, do it, and I will give you one of the younger
Graces for you to marry, and she shall be called your lady;
Pasithea, since all your days you have loved her forever.'
