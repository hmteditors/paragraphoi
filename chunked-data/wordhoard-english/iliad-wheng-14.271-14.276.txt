'Come then! Swear it to me on Styx' ineluctable water.
With one hand take hold of the prospering earth, with the other
take hold of the shining salt sea, so that all the undergods
who gather about Kronos may be witnesses to us.
Swear that you will give me one of the younger Graces,
Pasithea, the one whom all my days I have longed for.'
