'Argives, now once more must we give the best of it to Hektor,
Priam's son, so he may take our ships and win glory from them?
Such is his thought and such is his prayer, because now Achilleus
in the anger of his heart stays still among the hollow ships.
But there will not be too much longing for him, if the others
of us can stir ourselves up to stand by each other.
Come; then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us
take those shields which are best in all the army and biggest
and put them on, and cover our heads in the complete shining
of helmets, and take in our hands our spears that are longest
and go. I myself will lead the way, and I think that no longer
Hektor, Priam's son, can stand up to us, for all his fury.
Let the man stubborn in battle who wears a small shield on his shoulder
give it to a worse man, and put on the shield that is bigger.'
