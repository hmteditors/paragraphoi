'You Argives, arrow-fighters, insatiate of menace. I think
we shall not be the only ones to be given hard work
and sorrow, but you too must sometimes die, as this man did.
Think how Promachos sleeps among you, beaten down under
my spear, so that punishment for my brother may not go
long unpaid. Therefore a man prays he will leave behind him
one close to him in his halls to avenge his downfall in battle.'
