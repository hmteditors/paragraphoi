when we sons of the Achaians come home from Troy in our vessels.'
So he spoke, and the shivers came over the limbs of all of them,
and each man looked about him for a way to escape the sheer death.
Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,
who was first of the Achaians to win the bloody despoilment
of men, when the glorious shaker of the earth bent the way of the battle?
First Telamonian Aias cut down Hyrtios, he who
was son to Gyrtios, and lord over the strong-hearted Mysians.
Antilochos slaughtered Phalkes and Mermeros. Morys
and Hippotion were killed by Meriones. Teukros cut down
Periphetes and Prothoön. Next the son of Atreus,
Menelaos, stabbed Hyperenor, shepherd of the people,
in the flank, so the bronze head let gush out the entrails
through the torn side. His life came out through the wound of the spearstab
in beating haste, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.
But Aias the fast-footed son of Oïleus caught and killed most,
since there was none like him in the speed of his feet to go after
men who ran, once Zeus had driven the terror upon them.
