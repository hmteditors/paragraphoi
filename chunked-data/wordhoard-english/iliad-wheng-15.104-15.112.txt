'Fools, we who try to work against Zeus, thoughtlessly.
Still we are thinking in our anger to go near, and stop him
by argument or force. He sits apart and cares nothing
nor thinks of us, and says that among the other immortals
he is pre-eminently the greatest in power and strength. Therefore
each of you must take whatever evil he sends you.
Since I think already a sorrow has been wrought against Ares.
His son has been killed in the fighting, dearest of all men
to him, Askalaphos, whom stark Ares calls his own son.'
