So he spoke, and ordered Fear and Terror to harness
his horses, and himself got into his shining armour.
And there might have been wrought another anger, and bitterness
from Zeus, still greater, more wearisome among the immortals,
had not Athene, in her fear for the sake of all gods,
sprung up and out through the forecourt, left her chair where she was sitting,
and taken the helmet off from his head, the shield from his shoulders,
and snatched out of his heavy hand the bronze spear, and fixed it
apart, and then in speech reasoned with violent Ares:
'Madman, mazed of your wits, this is ruin! Your ears can listen
still to reality, but your mind is gone and your discipline.
Do you not hear what the goddess Hera of the white arms tells us,
and she coming back even now from Zeus of Olympos?
Do you wish, after running the course of many misfortunes
yourself, still to come back to Olympos under compulsion
though reluctant, and plant seed of great sorrow among the rest of us?
Since he will at once leave the Achaians and the high-hearted
Trojans, and come back to batter us on Olympos
and will catch up as they come the guilty one and the guiltless.
Therefore I ask of you to give up your anger for your son.
By now some other, better of his strength and hands than your son was,
has been killed, or will soon be killed; and it is a hard thing
to rescue all the generation and seed of all mortals.'
