So the lady Hera spoke, and once more returning
sat on her throne. They in a flash of speed winged their way onward.
They came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,
and found the wide-browed son of Kronos on the height of Gargaron,
sitting still, and fragrant cloud gathered in a circle about him.
These two came into the presence of Zeus the cloud-gatherer
and stood, nor was his heart angry when he looked upon them,
seeing they had promptly obeyed the message of his dear lady.
He spoke to Iris first of the two, and addressed her in winged words:
'Go on your way now, swift Iris, to the lord Poseidon,
and give him all this message nor be a false messenger. Tell him
that he must now quit the war and the fighting, and go back
among the generations of gods, or into the bright sea.
And if he will not obey my words, or thinks nothing of them,
then let him consider in his heart and his spirit
that he might not, strong though he is, be able to stand up
to my attack; since I say I am far greater than he is
in strength, and elder born; yet his inward heart shrinks not from calling
himself the equal of me, though others shudder before me.'
