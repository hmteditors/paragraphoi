'Take heart; such an avenger am I whom the son of Kronos
sent down from Ida, to stand by your side and defend you,
Phoibos Apollo of the golden sword, who in time before this
also have stood to defend yourself and your sheer citadel.
So come now, and urge on your cavalry in their numbers
to drive on their horses against the hollow ships. Meanwhile
I shall move on before you and make all the way for the horses
smooth before them, and bend back the Achaian fighters.'
