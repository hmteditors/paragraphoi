He spoke, and Teukros heard and came running to stand beside him
holding in his hand the backstrung bow and the quiver
to hold arrows, and let go his hard shots against the Trojans.
First he struck down Kleitos, the glorious son of Peisenor
and companion of Poulydamas, proud son of Panthoös.
Now Kleitos held the reins, and gave all his care to the horses,
driving them into that place where the most battalions were shaken,
for the favour of Hektor and the Trojans, but the sudden evil

for the painful arrow was driven into his neck from behind him.
He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses
shied away, rattling the empty car; but Poulydamas

He gave them into the hands of Astynoös, Protiaon's
son, with many orders to be watchful and hold the horses
close; then himself went back into the ranks of the champions.

Hektor, and would have stopped his fighting by the ships of the Achaians
had he hit him during his bravery and torn the life from him;
but he was not hidden from the close purpose of Zeus, who was guarding
Hektor, and denied that glory to Telamonian Teukros;
who broke in the unfaulted bow the close-twisted sinew
