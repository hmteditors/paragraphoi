'Dear brother, then let your bow and your showering arrows
lie, now that the god begrudging the Danaans wrecked them.
But take a long spear in your hands, a shield on your shoulder,
and close with the Trojans, and drive on the rest of your people.
Let them not, though they have beaten us, easily capture
our strong-benched ships. We must remember the frenzy of fighting.'
