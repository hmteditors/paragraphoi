He spoke, and Teukros put away the bow in his shelter
and threw across his shoulders the shield of the fourfold ox-hide.
Over his mighty head he set the well-fashioned helmet
with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.
Then he caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,
and went on his way, running fast, and stood beside Aias.
But Hektor, when he saw how the arrows of Teukros were baffled,
lifted his voice in a great cry to the Trojans and Lykians:
'Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,
be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour
along the hollow ships, since I have seen with my own eyes
how by the hand of Zeus their bravest man's arrows were baffled.
Easily seen is the strength that is given from Zeus to mortals
either in those into whose hands he gives the surpassing
glory, or those he diminishes and will not defend them
as now he diminishes the strength of the Argives, and helps us.
Fight on then by the ships together. He who among you
finds by spear thrown or spear thrust his death and destiny,
let him die. He has no dishonour when he dies defending
his country, for then his wife shall be saved and his children afterwards,
and his house and property shall not be damaged, if the Achaians
must go away with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers.'
