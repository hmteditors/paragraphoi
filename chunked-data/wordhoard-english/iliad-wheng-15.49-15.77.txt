'If even you, lady Hera of the ox eyes, hereafter
were to take your place among the immortals thinking as I do,
then Poseidon, hard though he may wish it otherwise,
must at once turn his mind so it follows your heart, and my heart.
If now all this that you say is real, and you speak truthfully,
go now among the generations of the gods, and summon
Iris to come here to me, and Apollo the glorious archer,
so that Iris may go among the bronze-armoured people
of the Achaians, and give a message to lord Poseidon
to leave the fighting and come back to the home that is his. Also
let Phoibos Apollo stir Hektor back into battle,
breathe strength into him once more, and make him forget the agonies
that now are wearing out his senses. Let him drive strengthless
panic into the Achaians, and turn them back once more;
let them be driven in flight and tumble back on the benched ships
of Achilleus, Peleus' son. And he shall rouse up Patroklos
his companion. And glorious Hektor shall cut down Patroklos
with the spear before Ilion, after he has killed many others
of the young men, and among them my own son, shining Sarpedon.
In anger for him brilliant Achilleus shall then kill Hektor.
And from then on I would make the fighting surge back from the vessels
always and continuously, until the Achaians
capture headlong Ilion through the designs of Athene.
Before this I am not stopping my anger, and I will not let
any other of the immortals stand there by the Danaans
until the thing asked by the son of Peleus has been accomplished
as I undertook at the first and bent my head in assent to it
on that day when embracing my knees immortal Thetis
supplicated honour for Achilleus, sacker of cities.'
