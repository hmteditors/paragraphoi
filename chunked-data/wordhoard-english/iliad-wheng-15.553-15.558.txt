'Shall we give way so, Melanippos? Does it mean nothing
even to you in the inward heart that your cousin is fallen?
Do you not see how they are busied over the armour of Dolops?
Come on, then; no longer can we stand far off and fight with
the Argives. Sooner we must kill them, or else sheer Ilion
be stormed utterly by them, and her citizens be killed.'
