'Ask me nothing of this, divine Themis. You yourself
know what his spirit is, how it is stubborn and arrogant.
Preside still over the gods in their house, the feast's fair division.
Yet so much may you hear, and with you all the immortals,
how Zeus discloses evil actions, and I do not think
the heart of all will be pleasured alike, neither among mortals
nor gods either, although one now still feasts at his pleasure.'
