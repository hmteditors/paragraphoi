'Myrmidons, companions of Peleus' son, Achilleus,
be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour;
we must bring honour to Peleus' son, far the greatest of the Argives
by the ships, we, even the henchmen who fight beside him,
so Atreus' son wide-ruling Agamemnon may recognize
his madness, that he did no honour to the best of the Achaians.'
