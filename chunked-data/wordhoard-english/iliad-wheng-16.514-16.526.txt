'Hear me, my lord. You are somewhere in the rich Lykian countryside
or here in Troy, and wherever you are you can listen
to a man in pain, as now this pain has descended upon me.
For see, I have this strong wound on me, and my arm on both sides
is driven with sharp pains about, my blood is not able
to dry and stop running, my shoulder is aching beneath it.
I cannot hold my spear up steady, I cannot go forward
to fight against the enemy. And the best of men has perished,
Sarpedon, son of Zeus; who will not stand by his children.
No, but you at least, my lord, make well this strong wound;
and put the pains to sleep, give me strength, so that I may call out
to my companions, the Lykians, and stir them to fight on,
and I myself do battle over the fallen body.'
