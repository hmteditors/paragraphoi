now you have utterly forgotten your armed companions
who for your sake, far from their friends and the land of their fathers,
are wearing their lives away, and you will do nothing to help them.
Sarpedon has fallen, the lord of the shield-armoured Lykians,
who defended Lykia in his strength and the right of his justice.
Now brazen Ares has struck him down by the spear of Patroklos.
Then, friends, stand beside me, let the thought be shame in your spirit
that they might strip away his arms, and dishonour his body,
these Myrmidons, in anger for all the Danaans perished,
those whom we Lykians have killed with the spear by the swift ships.'
