'Aiantes, now your desire must be to defend yourselves, and be
such as you were among men before, or even more valiant.
The man is fallen who first scaled the wall of the Achaians,
Sarpedon. If only we could win and dishonour his body
and strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill with the pitiless
bronze some one of his companions who fight to defend him.'
