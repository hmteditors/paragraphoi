He spoke so, and Apollo, not disregarding his father,
went down along the mountains of Ida, into the grim fight,
and lifting brilliant Sarpedon out from under the weapons
carried him far away, and washed him in a running river,
and anointed him in ambrosia, put ambrosial clothing upon him,

wall, and three times Phoibos Apollo battered him backward
with the immortal hands beating back the bright shield. As Patroklos
for the fourth time, like something more than a man, came at him
he called aloud, and spoke winged words in the voice of danger:
