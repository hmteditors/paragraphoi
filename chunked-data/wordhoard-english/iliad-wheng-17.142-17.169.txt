'Hektor, splendid to look at, you come far short in your fighting.
That fame of yours, high as it is, belongs to a runner.
Take thought now how to hold fast your town, your citadel
by yourself, with those your people who were born in Ilion;
since no Lykian will go forth now to fight with the Danaans

have made the hard hateful work come between them and their enemies,
we could quickly get the body of Patroklos inside Ilion.
If, dead man though he be, he could be brought into the great city
of lord Priam, if we could tear him out of the fighting,
the Argives must at once give up the beautiful armour
of Sarpedon, and we could carry his body inside Ilion.

of the great heart, nor to look at his eyes in the clamour of fighting
men, nor attack him direct, since he is far better than you are.'
Looking darkly at him tall Hektor of the shining helm answered:
