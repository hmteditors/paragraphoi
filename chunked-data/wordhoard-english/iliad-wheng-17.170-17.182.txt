'Glaukos, why did a man like you speak this word of annoyance?
I am surprised. I thought that for wits you surpassed all others
of those who dwell in Lykia where the soil is generous; and yet
now I utterly despise your heart for the thing you have spoken
when you said I cannot stand in the face of gigantic Aias.
I am not one who shudders at attack and the thunder of horses.
But always the mind of Zeus is a stronger thing than a man's mind.
He terrifies even the warlike man, he takes away victory
lightly, when he himself has driven a man into battle.
Come here, friend, and watch me at work; learn, standing beside me,
whether I shall be a coward all day, as you proclaim me,
or whether I stop some Danaan, for all of his fury,
from his fighting strength and from the defence of fallen Patroklos.'
