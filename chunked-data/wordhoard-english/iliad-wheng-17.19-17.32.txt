'Father Zeus, it is not well for the proud man to glory.
Neither the fury of the leopard is such, not such is the lion's,
nor the fury of the devastating wild boar, within whose breast
the spirit is biggest and vaunts in the pride of his strength, is so great
as goes the pride in these sons of Pantho√∂s of the strong ash spear.
Yet even the strength of Hyperenor, breaker of horses,
had no joy of his youth when he stood against me and taunted me
and said that among all the Danaans I was the weakest
in battle. Yet I think that his feet shall no more carry him
back, to pleasure his beloved wife and his honoured parents.
So I think I can break your strength as well, if you only
stand against me. No, but I myself tell you to get back
into the multitude, not stand to face me, before you
take some harm. Once a thing has been done, the fool sees it.'
