'Hear me, you numberless hordes of companions who live at our borders.
It was not for any desire nor need of a multitude
that man by man I gathered you to come here from your cities,
but so that you might have good will to defend the innocent
children of the Trojans, and their wives, from the fighting Achaians.
With such a purpose I wear out my own people for presents
and food, wherewith I make strong the spirit within each one of you.
Therefore a man must now turn his face straight forward, and perish
or survive. This is the sweet invitation of battle.
That man of you who drags Patroklos, dead as he is, back
among Trojans, breakers of horses, and Aias gives way before him,
I will give him half the spoils for his portion, and keep half
for myself, and his glory shall be as great as mine is.'
