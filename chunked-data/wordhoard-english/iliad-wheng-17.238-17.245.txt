'Illustrious Menelaos, dear friend, I no longer have hope
that even you and I can win back out of the fighting.
My fear is not so much for the dead body of Patroklos
who presently must glut the dogs and the birds of Troy, so much
as I fear for my own head, my life, and what may befall it,
and for yours, since this cloud of war is darkened on all things,
this Hektor, while for you and me sheer death is emerging.
Come then, call the great men of the Danaans, if one might hear you.'
