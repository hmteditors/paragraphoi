'Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,
you that beside Agamemnon and Menelaos, the two sons
of Atreus, drink the community's wine and give, each man, his orders
to the people; and from Zeus the respect and honour attend you.
It is hard for me to discriminate among you each man
who is a leader, so big is the bitter fight that has blazed up.
Then let a man come of his own accord, think it shameful
that Patroklos be given to the dogs of Troy to delight them.'
