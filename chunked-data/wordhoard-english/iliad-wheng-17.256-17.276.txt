and was first to come running along the battle, and join him,
and after him Idomeneus, and Idomeneus' companion

The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them.
As when at the outpouring place of a rain-glutted river
the huge surf of the sea roars against the current, out-jutting
beaches thunder aloud to the backwash of the salt water,
with such a bellow the Trojans came on, but now the Achaians
stood fast about the son of Menoitios, in a single courage
and fenced beneath their bronze-armoured shields, while the son of Kronos
drifted across the glitter of their helmets a deepening

son, while he lived yet and was Achilleus' companion,
and loathed now that he should become the spoil of the hated
