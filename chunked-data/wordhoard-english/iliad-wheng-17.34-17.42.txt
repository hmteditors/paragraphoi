'Then, lordly Menelaos, you must now pay the penalty
for my brother, whom you killed, and boast that you did it,
and made his wife a widow in the depth of a young bride chamber
and left to his parents the curse of lamentation and sorrow.
Yet I might stop the mourning of these unhappy people
if I could carry back to them your head, and your armour,
and toss them into Pantho√∂s' hands, and to Phrontis the lovely.
No, this struggle shall not go long untested between us
nor yet unfought, whether it prove our strength or our terror.'
