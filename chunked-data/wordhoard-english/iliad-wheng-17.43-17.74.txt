He spoke, and stabbed Menelaos' shield in its perfect circle,
nor did the bronze break its way through, but the spearhead bent back
in the strong shield. And after him Atreus' son, Menelaos,
made his prayer to father Zeus and lunged with the bronze spear
and as he was drawing back caught him in the pit of the gullet
and leaned in on the stroke in the confidence of his strong hand,
and clean through the soft part of the neck the spearpoint was driven.
He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him,
and his hair, lovely as the Graces, was splattered with blood, those
braided locks caught waspwise in gold and silver. As some
slip of an olive tree strong-growing that a man raises
in a lonely place, and drenched it with generous water, so that
it blossoms into beauty, and the blasts of winds from all quarters
tremble it, and it bursts into pale blossoming. But then
a wind suddenly in a great tempest descending upon it
wrenches it out of its stand and lays it at length on the ground; such
was Euphorbos of the strong ash spear, the son of Panthoös,
whom Menelaos Atreides killed, and was stripping his armour.
As when in the confidence of his strength some lion
hill-reared snatches the finest cow in a herd as it pastures;
first the lion breaks her neck caught fast in the strong teeth,
then gulps down the blood and all the guts that are inward
savagely, as the dogs and the herdsmen raise a commotion
loudly about him, but from a distance, and are not willing
to go in and face him, since the hard green fear has hold of them;
so no heart in the breast of any Trojan had courage
to go in and face glorious Menelaos. Then easily
the son of Atreus might have taken the glorious armour
from Panthoös' son, only Phoibos Apollo begrudged him
and stirred up Hektor, a match for the running war god, against him
in semblance of a man, the leader of the Kikones,
Mentes, and spoke aloud to him, and addressed him in winged words:
