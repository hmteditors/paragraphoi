He spoke, and the dark cloud of sorrow closed over Hektor.
He took his way among the champions helmed in the shining
bronze. And now the son of Kronos caught up the betasselled
glaring aegis, and shrouded Ida in mists. He let go
a lightning flash and a loud thunderstroke, shaking the mountain,
gave victory to the Trojans, and terrified the Achaians.
First to begin the flight was Peneleos the Boiotian.
For he, turning always toward the attack, was hit in the shoulder's
end, a slight wound, but the spear of Poulydamas, who had thrown it
from a stance very close to him, had grated the bone's edge.
Then Hektor wounded in the hand by the wrist Leïtos,
the son of great-hearted Alektryon, and halted his warcraft,
and he drew back staring about him since his spirit had hope no longer
of holding a spear steady in his hand to fight with the Trojans.
Now as Hektor made a rush for Leïtos, Idomeneus
struck him on the corselet over the chest by the nipple,
but the long shaft was broken behind the head, and the Trojans
shouted. Now Hektor made a cast at Deukalian Idomeneus
as he stood in his chariot, and missed him by only a little,
but struck the follower and charioteer of Meriones,
Koiranos, who had come with him from strong-founded Lyktos.
Now Idomeneus at the first had come on foot, leaving the oarswept
ships, and now would have given the Trojans a mighty triumph,
had not Koiranos swiftly come up with the fast-running horses;
came as light to the other and beat from him the day without pity,
but himself lost his life at the hands of manslaughtering Hektor,
who hit him under the jaw by the ear, and the spearshaft pushed out
his teeth by the roots from the base, and split the tongue through the middle.
He toppled from the chariot, with the reins on the ground scattered,
but Meriones leaning down caught these up in his own hands
from the surface of the plain, and called aloud to Idomeneus:
