'Antilochos, turn this way, illustrious, and hear from me
the ghastly message of a thing I wish never had happened.
You can see for yourself, I think, already, from watching,
how the god is wheeling disaster against the Danaans
and how the Trojans are winning. The best of the Achaians has fallen,
Patroklos, and a huge loss is inflicted upon the Danaans.
Run then quickly to Achilleus, by the ships of the Achaians,
and tell him. He might in speed win back to his ship the dead body
which is naked. Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.'
