'All you have said, renowned Menelaos, is fair and orderly.
But come: you and Meriones stoop and shoulder the body
at once, and carry it out of the hard fighting. Behind you
we two shall fight off the Trojans and glorious Hektor,
we, who have the same name, the same spirit, and who in times past
have stood fast beside each other in the face of the bitter war god.'
