He spoke, and they caught the body from the ground in their arms, lifting
him high with a great heave, and the Trojan people behind them
shouted aloud as they saw the Achaians lifting the dead man,
and made a rush against them like dogs, who sweep in rapidly

and for the moment race in raging to tear him to pieces
until in the confidence of his strength he turns on them, at bay,
