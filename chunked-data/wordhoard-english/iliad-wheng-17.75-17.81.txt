'While you, Hektor, run after what can never be captured,
the horses of valiant Aiakides; they are difficult horses
for mortal man to manage, or even to ride behind them
for all except Achilleus, who was born of an immortal mother;
meanwhile Menelaos, the warlike son of Atreus,
stands over Patroklos and has killed the best man of the Trojans,
Euphorbos, Pantho√∂s' son, and stopped his furious valour.'
