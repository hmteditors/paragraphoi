'Ah me; if I abandon here the magnificent armour,
and Patroklos, who has fallen here for the sake of my honour,
shall not some one of the Danaans, seeing it, hold it against me?
Yet if I fight, alone as I am, the Trojans and Hektor
for shame, shall they not close in, many against one, about me?
Hektor of the shining helm leads all of the Trojans
here. Then why does my own heart within me debate this?
When a man, in the face of divinity, would fight with another
whom some god honours, the big disaster rolls sudden upon him.
Therefore, let no Danaan seeing it hold it against me
if I give way before Hektor, who fights from God. Yet if somewhere
I could only get some word of Aias of the great war cry,
we two might somehow go, and keep our spirit of battle
even in the face of divinity, if we might win the body
for Pele√Ød Achilleus. It would be our best among evils.'
