'Son of Atreus: now, my lord, the Achaians are trying
to make you into a thing of reproach in the sight of all mortal
men, and not fulfilling the promise they undertook once
as they set forth to come here from horse-pasturing Argos,
to go home only after you had sacked strong-walled Ilion.
For as if they were young children or widowed women
they cry out and complain to each other about going homeward.
