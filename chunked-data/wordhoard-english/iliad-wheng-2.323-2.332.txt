"Why are you turned voiceless, you flowing-haired Achaians?
Zeus of the counsels has shown us this great portent: a thing late,
late to be accomplished, whose glory shall perish never.
As this snake has eaten the sparrow herself with her children,
eight of them, and the mother was the ninth, who bore them,
so for years as many as this shall we fight in this place
and in the tenth year we shall take the city of the wide ways."
So he spoke to us then; now all this is being accomplished.
Come then, you strong-greaved Achaians, let every man stay
here, until we have taken the great citadel of Priam.'
