'Oh, for shame! You are like children when you hold assembly,
infant children, to whom the works of war mean nothing.
Where then shall our covenants go, and the oaths we have taken?
Let counsels and the meditations of men be given to the flames then,
with the unmixed wine poured and the right hands we trusted.
We do our fighting with words only, and can discover
no remedy, though we have stayed here a long time. Son of Atreus,
do you still as before hold fast to your counsel unshaken
and be the leader of the Argives through the strong encounters;
let them go perish, these one or two, who think apart from
the rest of the Achaians, since there will be no use in them
until they get back again to Argos without ever learning
whether Zeus of the aegis promises false or truly.
For I say to you, the son of all-powerful Kronos
promised, on that day when we went in our fast-running vessels,
we of Argos, carrying blood and death to the Trojans.
He flashed lightning on our right, showing signs of favour.
Therefore let no man be urgent to take the way homeward
until after he has lain in bed with the wife of a Trojan
to avenge Helen's longing to escape and her lamentations.
But if any man is terribly desirous to go home,
let him only lay his hands on his well-benched black ship,
that before all others he may win death and destruction.
Come, my lord: yourself be careful, and listen to another.
This shall not be a word to be cast away that I tell you.
Set your men in order by tribes, by clans, Agamemnon,
and let clan go in support of clan, let tribe support tribe.
If you do it this way, and the Achaians obey you,
you will see which of your leaders is bad, and which of your people,
and which also is brave, since they will fight in divisions,
