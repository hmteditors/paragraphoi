'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,
let us talk no more of these things, nor for a long time
set aside the action which the god puts into our hands now.
Come then, let the heralds of the bronze-armoured Achaians
make proclamation to the people and assemble them by the vessels,
and let us together as we are go down the wide host
of the Achaians, to stir more quickly the fierce war god.'
