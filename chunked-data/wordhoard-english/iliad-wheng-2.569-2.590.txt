But the men who held Mykenai, the strong-founded citadel,
Korinth the luxurious, and strong-founded Kleonai;
they who dwelt in Orneai and lovely Araithyrea,
and Sikyon, where of old Adrestos had held the kingship;
they who held Hyperesia and steep GonoÃ«ssa,
they who held Pellene and they who dwelt about Aigion,
all about the sea-shore and about the wide headland of Helike,
of their hundred ships the leader was powerful Agamemnon,
Atreus' son, with whom followed far the best and bravest
people; and among them he himself stood armoured in shining
bronze, glorying, conspicuous among the great fighters,
since he was greatest among them all, and led the most people.
They who held the swarming hollow of Lakedaimon,
Pharis, and Sparta, and Messe of the dove-cotes,
they who dwelt in Bryseiai and lovely Augeiai,
they who held Amyklai and the seaward city of Helos,
they who held Laas, and they who dwelt about Oitylos,
of these his brother Menelaos of the great war cry
was leader, with sixty ships marshalled apart from the others.
He himself went among them in the confidence of his valour,
driving them battleward, since above all his heart was eager
to avenge Helen's longing to escape and her lamentations.
