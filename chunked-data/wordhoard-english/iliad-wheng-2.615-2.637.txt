They who lived in Bouprasion and brilliant Elis,
all as much as Hyrmine and Myrsinos the uttermost
and the Olenian rock and Alesion close between them,
of these there were four chieftains, and with each man ten swift
vessels followed, with many Epeian men on board them.
Of two tens Thalpios and Amphimachos were leaders,
of Aktor's seed, sons one of Kteatos, one of Eurytos.
Ten more were led by Amaryngkeus' son, strong Diores,
and of the fourth ten godlike Polyxeinos was leader,
son of lord Agasthenes, of the race of Augeias.
They who came from Doulichion and the sacred Echinai,
islands, where men live across the water from Elis,
Meges was the leader of these, a man like Ares,
Phyleus' son, whom the rider dear to Zeus had begotten,
Phyleus, who angered with his father had settled Doulichion.
Following along with him were forty black ships.
But Odysseus led the high-hearted men of Kephallenia,
those who held Ithaka and leaf-trembling Neriton,
those who dwelt about Krokyleia and rigged Aigilips,
those who held Zakynthos and those who dwelt about Samos,
those who held the mainland and the places next to the crossing.
All these men were led by Odysseus, like Zeus in counsel.
Following with him were twelve ships with bows red painted.
