Herakles' son Tlepolemos the huge and mighty
led from Rhodes nine ships with the proud men of Rhodes aboard them,
those who dwelt about Rhodes and were ordered in triple division,
Ialysos and Lindos and silver-shining Kameiros.
Of all these Tlepolemos the spear-famed was leader,
he whom Astyocheia bore to the strength of Herakles.
Herakles brought her from Ephyra and the river SelleÃ«is
after he sacked many cities of strong, god-supported fighters.
Now when Tlepolemos was grown in the strong-built mansion,
he struck to death his own father's beloved uncle,
Likymnios, scion of Ares, a man already ageing.
At once he put ships together and assembled a host of people
and went fugitive over the sea, since the others threatened,
the rest of the sons and the grandsons of the strength of Herakles.
And he came to Rhodes a wanderer, a man of misfortune,
and they settled there in triple division by tribes, beloved
of Zeus himself, who is lord over all gods and all men,
Kronos' son, who showered the wonder of wealth upon them.
