They who lived about Thaumakia and Methone,
they who held Meliboia and rugged Olizon,
of their seven ships the leader was Philoktetes
skilled in the bow's work, and aboard each vessel were fifty
oarsmen, each well skilled in the strength of the bow in battle.
Yet he himself lay apart in the island, suffering strong pains,
in Lemnos the sacrosanct, where the sons of the Achaians had left him
in agony from the sore bite of the wicked water snake.
There he lay apart in his pain; yet soon the Argives
beside their ships were to remember lord Philoktetes.
Yet these, longing as they did for their leader, did not go leaderless,
but Medon, the bastard son of Oileus, set them in order,
whom Rhene bore to OÃ¯leus the sacker of cities.
