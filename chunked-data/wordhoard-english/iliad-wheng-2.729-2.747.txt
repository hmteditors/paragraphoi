They who held Trikke and the terraced place of Ithome,
and Oichalia, the city of Oichalian Eurytos,
of these in turn the leaders were two sons of Asklepios,
good healers both themselves, Podaleirios and Machaon.
In their command were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.
They who held Ormenios and the spring Hypereia,
they who held Asterion and the pale peaks of Titanos,
Eurypylos led these, the shining son of Euaimon.
Following along with him were forty black ships.
They who held Argissa and dwelt about Gyrtone,
Orthe and Elone and the white city Oloösson,
of these the leader was Polypoites, stubborn in battle,
son of Peirithoös whose father was Zeus immortal,
he whom glorious Hippodameia bore to Peirithoös
on that day when he wreaked vengeance on the hairy beast men
and drove them from Pelion and hurled them against the Aithikes;
not by himself, for Leonteus was with him, scion of Ares,
Leonteus, son of high-hearted Koronos the son of Kaineus.
Following in the guidance of these were forty black ships.
