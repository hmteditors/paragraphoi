Near the city but apart from it there is a steep hill
in the plain by itself, so you pass one side or the other.
This men call the Hill of the Thicket, but the immortal
gods have named it the burial mound of dancing Myrina.
There the Trojans and their companions were marshalled in order.
Tall Hektor of the shining helm was leader of the Trojans,
Priam's son; and with him far the best and the bravest
fighting men were armed and eager to fight with the spear's edge.
