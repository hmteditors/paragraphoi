They who held Adresteia and the countryside of Apaisos,
they who held Pityeia and the sheer hill of Tereia,
these were led by Adrestos and Amphios armoured in linen,
sons both of Merops of Perkote, who beyond all men
knew the art of prophecy, and tried to prevent his two sons
from going into the battle where men die. Yet these would not
listen, for the spirits of dark death were driving them onward.
