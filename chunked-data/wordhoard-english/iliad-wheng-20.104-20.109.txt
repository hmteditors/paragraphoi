'Hero, then make your prayer, you also, to the everlasting
gods, since they say that you yourself are born of Zeus' daughter

Aphrodite being daughter of Zeus, Thetis of the sea's ancient.
Carry your weariless bronze straight against him, let him by no means
turn you back by blustering words and his threats of terror.'
