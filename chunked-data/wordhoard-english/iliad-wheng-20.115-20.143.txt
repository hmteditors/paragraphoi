'Poseidon and Athene, now take counsel between you
and within your hearts as to how these matters shall be accomplished.
Here is Aineias gone helmed in the shining bronze against
Peleus' son, and it was Phoibos Apollo who sent him.
Come then, we must even go down ourselves and turn him
back from here, or else one of us must stand by Achilleus
and put enormous strength upon him, and let him not come short
in courage, but let him know that they love him who are the highest
of the immortals, but those who before now fended the fury
of war, as now, from the Trojans are as wind and nothing.
For all of us have come down from Olympos to take our part
in this battle, so nothing may be done to him by the Trojans
on this day. Afterwards he shall suffer such things as Destiny
wove with the strand of his birth that day he was born to his mother.
But if Achilleus does not hear all this from gods' voices
he will be afraid, when a god puts out his strength against him
in the fighting. It is hard for gods to be shown in their true shape.'
In turn Poseidon the shaker of the earth answered her:
'Hera, do not be angry without purpose. It does not
become you, since I at least would not have the rest of us gods
encounter in battle, since indeed we are far too strong for them.
Let us then go away and sit down together off the path
at a viewing place, and let the men take care of their fighting.
Only if Ares begins to fight, or Phoibos Apollo,
or if they hold Achilleus back and will not let him fight,
then at once they will have a quarrel with us on their hands
in open battle. But soon, I think, when they have fought with us
they will get back to Olympos and the throng of the other gods
beaten back by the overmastering strength of our hands.'
