'Shaker of the earth, you yourself must decide in your own heart
about Aineias, whether to rescue him or to let him
go down, for all his strength, before Peleus' son, Achilleus.
For we two, Pallas Athene and I, have taken
numerous oaths and sworn them in the sight of all the immortals
never to drive the day of evil away from the Trojans,
not even when all the city of Troy is burned in the ravening
fire, on that day when the warlike sons of the Achaians burn it.'
