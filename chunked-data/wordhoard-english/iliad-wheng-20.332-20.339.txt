which one of the gods is it who urges you to such madness
that you fight in the face of Peleus' son, against his high courage
though he is both stronger than you and dearer to the immortals?
Give back rather, whenever you find yourself thrown against him,
lest beyond your fate you go down into the house of the death god.
But once Achilleus has fulfilled his death and his destiny,
then take courage, and go on, and fight with their foremost,
since there shall be no other Achaian able to kill you.'
