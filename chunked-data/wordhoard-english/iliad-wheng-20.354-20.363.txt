'No longer stand away from the Trojans, o great Achaians,
but let each one go to face his man, furious to fight him.
It is a hard thing for me, for all my great strength, to harry
the flight of men in such numbers or to fight with all of them.
Not Ares, who is a god immortal, not even Athene
could take the edge of such masses of men and fight a way through them.
But what I can do with hands and feet and strength I tell you
I will do, and I shall not hang back even a little
but go straight on through their formation, and I think that no man
of the Trojans will be glad when he comes within my spear's range.'
