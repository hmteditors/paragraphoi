'High-hearted son of Peleus, why ask of my generation?
I am from Paionia far away, where the soil is generous,
and lead the men of Paionia with long spears; and this for me
is the eleventh day since I arrived in Ilion.
For my generation, it is from the broad waters of Axios,
Axios, who floods the land with the loveliest waters.
His son was Pelegon the spear-famed; but men say I am Pelegon's
son; now, glorious Achilleus, we shall fight together.'
