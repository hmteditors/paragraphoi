the Pelian ash spear, but the warrior Asteropaios
threw with both spears at the same time, being ambidextrous.
With the one spear he hit the shield but could not altogether

Three times he struggled straining to wrench it clear, and three times
gave over the effort, and now for the fourth time he was bending
