'Do not be afraid, son of Peleus, nor be so anxious,
such are we two of the gods who stand beside you to help you,
by the consent of Zeus, myself and Pallas Athene.
Thereby it is not your destiny to be killed by the river,
but he shall be presently stopped, and you yourself shall behold it.
'But we also have close counsel to give you, if you will believe us.
Do not let stay your hands from the collision of battle
until you have penned the people of Troy, those who escape you,
inside the famed wall of Ilion. Then when you have taken Hektor's life
go back again to the ships. We grant you the winning of glory.'
