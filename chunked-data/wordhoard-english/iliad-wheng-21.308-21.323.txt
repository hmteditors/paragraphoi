'Beloved brother, let even the two of us join to hold back
the strength of a man, since presently he will storm the great city
of lord Priam. The Trojans cannot stand up to him in battle.
But help me beat him off with all speed, and make full your currents
with water from your springs, and rouse up all of your torrents
and make a big wave rear up and wake the heavy confusion
and sound of timbers and stones, so we can stop this savage man
who is now in his strength and rages in fury like the immortals.
For I say that his strength will not be enough for him nor his beauty
nor his arms in their splendour, which somewhere deep down under the waters
shall lie folded under the mud; and I will whelm his own body
deep, and pile it over with abundance of sands and rubble
numberless, nor shall the Achaians know where to look for
his bones to gather them, such ruin will I pile over him.
And there shall his monument be made, and he will have no need
of any funeral mound to be buried in by the Achaians.'
