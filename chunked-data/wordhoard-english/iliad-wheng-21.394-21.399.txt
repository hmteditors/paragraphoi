'Why once more, you dogfly, have you stirred up trouble among the gods
with the blast of your blown fury, and the pride of your heart driving you?
Do you not remember how you set on Diomedes, Tydeus'
son, to spear me, and yourself laying hold of the far-seen pike
pushed it straight into me and tore my skin in its beauty.
So now I am minded to pay you back for all you have done me.'
