'You child; you did not think even this time how much stronger
I can claim I am than you, when you match your fury against me.
Therefore you are paying atonement to your mother's furies
since she is angry and wishes you ill, because you abandoned
the Achaians, and have given your aid to the insolent Trojans.'
