'You run from him, striker from afar. You have yielded Poseidon
the victory entire. He can brag, where nothing has happened.
Fool, then why do you wear that bow, which is wind and nothing.
Let me not hear you in the halls of my father boasting
ever again, as you did before among the immortals,
that you could match your strength in combat against Poseidon.'
