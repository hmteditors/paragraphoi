'Ah me! if I run away before the strength of Achilleus
in the way that others are stampeded in terror before him,
he will catch me even so and cut my throat like a coward's.
But if I leave these men to be driven in flight by Achilleus,
Peleus' son, and run on my feet in another direction
away from the wall to the plain of Ilion, until I come to
the spurs of Ida, and take cover there within the undergrowth,
then in the evening, when I have bathed in the river, and washed off
the sweat, I could make my way back again to Ilion.
Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?
This way, he might see me as I started to the plain from the city,
and go in pursuit, and in the speed of his feet overtake me.
Then there will be no way to escape death and the death spirits.
He is too strong, his strength is beyond all others'. But then if
I go out in front of the city and stand fast against him,
I think even his body might be torn by the sharp bronze.
There is only one life in him, and people say he is mortal.
It is only that Zeus, the son of Kronos, is granting him glory.'
