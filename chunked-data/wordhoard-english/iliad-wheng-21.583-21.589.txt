'You must have hoped within your heart, o shining Achilleus,
on this day to storm the city of the proud Trojans.
You fool! There is much hard suffering to be done for its winning,
since there are many of us inside, and men who are fighters,
who will stand before our beloved parents, our wives and our children,
to defend Ilion; but in this place you will find your destiny,
for all you are so headlong and so bold a warrior.'
