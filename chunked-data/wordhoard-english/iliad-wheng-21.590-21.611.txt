He spoke, and from his heavy hand let fly with the sharp spear
and struck him in the leg below the knee, nor entirely
missed him, and taking the spear the greave of new-wrought tin clattered
horribly, and back from the struck greave the bronze rebounded
without getting through, but the gift of the god defended Achilleus.
After him Peleus' son made his spring at godlike Agenor,
but Apollo would no further grant him the winning of glory
but caught Agenor away closing him in a dense mist
and sent him to make his way quietly out of the battle.
Then by deception he kept Peleion away from the people.
The striker from afar likened himself in all ways to Agenor
and stood there before his feet, and Achilleus sprang in chase of him
in the speed of his feet; for the time he chased him across the wheat-bearing
plain, turning him toward the deep whirls of the river Skamandros
as he ran a little in front; with the trick Apollo beguiled him
so that he hoped ever by running to catch up with him;
all this time the rest of the Trojans fled in a body
gladly into the town, and the city was filled with their swarming.
They dared no longer outside the wall and outside the city
to wait for each other and find out which one had got away
and who had died in the battle, so hastily were they streaming
into the city, each man as his knees and feet could rescue him.
