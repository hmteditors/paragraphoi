'Spercheios, it was in vain that Peleus my father vowed to you
that there, when I had won home to the beloved land of my fathers,
I would cut my hair for you and make you a grand and holy
sacrifice of fifty rams consecrate to the waters
of your springs, where is your holy ground and your smoking altar.
So the old man vowed, but you did not accomplish his purpose.
Now, since I do not return to the beloved land of my fathers,
I would give my hair into the keeping of the hero Patroklos.'
