'Good-bye, Patroklos. I hail you even in the house of the death god
For all that I promised you in time past I am accomplishing.
Here are twelve noble sons of the great-hearted Trojans
whom the fire feeds on, all, as it feeds on you. But I will not
give Hektor, Priam's son, to the fire, but the dogs, to feast on.'
