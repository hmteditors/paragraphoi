sit down. I am going back to the running waters of Ocean
and the Aithiopians' land, where they are making grand sacrifice
to the immortals; there I, too, shall partake of the sacraments.
But Achilleus' prayer is that Boreas and blustering Zephyros
may come to him, and he promises them splendid offerings,
so that you may set ablaze the funeral pyre, whereon lies
Patroklos, with all Achaians mourning about him.'
