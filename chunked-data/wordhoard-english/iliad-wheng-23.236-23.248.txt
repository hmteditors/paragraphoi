'Son of Atreus, and you other greatest of all the Achaians,
first put out with gleaming wine the pyre that is burning,
all that still has on it the fury of fire; and afterwards
we shall gather up the bones of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios,
which we shall easily tell apart, since they are conspicuous
where he lay in the middle of the pyre and the others far from him
at the edge burned, the men indiscriminately with the horses.
And let us lay his bones in a golden jar and a double
fold of fat, until I myself enfold him in Hades.
And I would have you build a grave mound which is not very great
but such as will be fitting, for now; afterwards, the Achaians
can make it broad and high--such of you Achaians as may be
left to survive me here by the benched ships, after I am gone.'
