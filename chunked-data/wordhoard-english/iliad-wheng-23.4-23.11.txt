Achilleus would not allow the Myrmidons to be scattered,
but called out to his companions whose delight was in battle:
'Myrmidons, you of the fast horses, my steadfast companions,
we must not yet slip free of the chariots our single-foot horses,
but with these very horses and chariots we must drive close up
to Patroklos and mourn him, since such is the privilege of the perished.
Then, when we have taken full satisfaction from the sorrowful
dirge, we shall set our horses free, and all of us eat here.'
