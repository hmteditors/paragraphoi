'No, before Zeus, who is greatest of gods and the highest,
there is no right in letting water come near my head, until
I have laid Patroklos on the burning pyre, and heaped the mound over him,
and cut my hair for him, since there will come no second sorrow
like this to my heart again while I am still one of the living.
Then let us now give way to the gloomy feast; and with the dawn
cause your people to rise, o lord of men Agamemnon,
and bring in timber and lay it by, with all that is fitting
for the dead man to have when he goes down under the gloom and the darkness,
so that with the more speed the unwearying fire may burn him
away from our eyes, and the people turn back to that which they must do.'
