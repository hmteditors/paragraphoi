'Idomeneus, what was all this windy talk? The light-footed
horses are still far where they sweep over the great plain.
You are not by so much the youngest among the Argives,
nor do the eyes in your head see so much sharper than others.
But forever you are windy with your words, and you should not
be a windy speaker. There are others here better than you are.
The horses who are in front are the same as before, and they are
those of Eumelos, and he stands holding the reins behind them.'
The lord of the Kretans answered him to his face in anger:
'Aias, surpassing in abuse, yet stupid, in all else
you are worst of the Argives with that stubborn mind of yours. Come then,
let us put up a wager of a tripod or cauldron
and make Agamemnon, son of Atreus, witness between us
as to which horses lead. And when you pay, you will find out.'
