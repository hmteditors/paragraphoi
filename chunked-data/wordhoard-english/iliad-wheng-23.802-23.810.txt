'We invite two men, the best among you, to contend for these prizes.
Let them draw their armour upon them and take up the rending bronze spears
and stand up to each other in the trial of close combat. The fighter
who is first of the two to get in a stroke at the other's fair body,
to get through armour and dark blood and reach to the vitals,
to that man I will give this magnificent silver-nailed
sword of Thrace I stripped from the body of Asteropaios.
But let both men carry off this armour and have it in common;
and we shall set out a brave dinner before them both in our shelters.'
