Speaking so the goddess left in her heart sweet longing
after her husband of time before, and her city and parents.
And at once, wrapping herself about in shimmering garments,
she went forth from the chamber, letting fall a light tear;
not by herself, since two handmaidens went to attend her,
Aithre, Pitteus' daughter, and Klymene of the ox eyes.
Rapidly they came to the place where the Skaian gates stood.
