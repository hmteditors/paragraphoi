'Listen to me, you Trojans and you strong-greaved Achaians.
Now I am going away to windy Ilion, homeward,
since I cannot look with these eyes on the sight of my dear son
fighting against warlike Menelaos in single combat.
Zeus knows--maybe he knows--and the rest of the gods immortal
for which of the two death is appointed to end this matter.'
