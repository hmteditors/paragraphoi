So they spoke, and tall Hektor of the shining helm shook
the lots, looking backward, and at once Paris' lot was outshaken.
All the rest sat down in their ranks on the ground, at the place where
the glittering armour of each was piled by his light-footed horses,
while one of them put about his shoulders his splendid armour,
brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen.
First he placed along his legs the fair greaves linked with
silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.
Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet
of Lykaon his brother since this fitted him also.
Across his shoulders he slung the sword with the nails of silver,
a bronze sword, and above it the great shield, huge and heavy.
Over his powerful head he set the well-fashioned helmet
with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.
He took up a strong-shafted spear that fitted his hand's grip.
In the same way warlike Menelaos put on his armour.
