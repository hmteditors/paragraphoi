'Dear brother, it was your death I sealed in the oaths of friendship,
setting you alone before the Achaians to fight with the Trojans.
So, the Trojans have struck you down and trampled on the oaths sworn.

with ships empty, and leaving behind him brave Menelaos."
Thus shall a man speak: then let the wide earth open to take me.'
Then in encouragement fair-haired Menelaos spoke to him:
