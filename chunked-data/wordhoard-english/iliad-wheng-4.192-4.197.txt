He spoke, and addressed Talthybios, his sacred herald:
'Talthybios, with all speed go call hither Machaon,
a man who is son of Asklepios and a blameless physician,
so that he may look at Menelaos, the warlike son of
Atreus, whom someone skilled in the bow's use shot with an arrow,
Trojan or Lykian: glory to him, but to us a sorrow.'
