'Argives, do not let go now of this furious valour.
Zeus the father shall not be one to give aid to liars,
but these, who were the first to do violence over the oaths sworn,
vultures shall feed upon the delicate skin of their bodies,
while we lead away their beloved wives and innocent
children, in our ships, after we have stormed their citadel.'
