'Son of Atreus, I will in truth be a staunch companion
in arms, as first I promised you and bent my head to it.
Rouse up rather the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians
so that we may fight in all speed, since the Trojans have broken
their oaths: a thing that shall be death and sorrow hereafter
to them, since they were the first to do violence over the oaths sworn.'
