'Aiantes, o leaders of the bronze-armoured Argives,
to you two I give no orders; it would not become me
to speed you, now that yourselves drive your people on to fight strongly.
Father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, if only
such a spirit were in the hearts of all of my people.
Then perhaps the city of lord Priam would be bent
underneath our hands, captured and utterly taken.'
