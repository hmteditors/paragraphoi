'Son of Atreus, so would I also wish to be that
man I was, when I cut down brilliant Ereuthalion.
But the gods give to mortals not everything at the same time;
if I was a young man then, now in turn old age is upon me.
Yet even so I shall be among the riders, and command them
with word and counsel; such is the privilege of the old men.
The young spearmen shall do the spear-fighting, those who are born
of a generation later than mine, who trust in their own strength.'
