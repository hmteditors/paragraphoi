'Rise up, Trojans, breakers of horses, bend not from battle
with these Argives. Surely their skin is not stone, not iron
to stand up under the tearing edge of the bronze as it strikes them.
No, nor is Achilleus the child of lovely-haired Thetis
fighting, but beside the ship mulls his heartsore anger.'
