So called the fearful god from the citadel, while Zeus' daughter
Tritogeneia, goddess most high, drove on the Achaians,
any of them she saw hanging back as she strode through the battle.
Now his doom caught fast Amaryngkeus' son Diores,
who with a jagged boulder was smitten beside the ankle
in the right shin, and a lord of the Thracian warriors threw it,
Peiros, son of Imbrasos, who had journeyed from Ainos.
The pitiless stone smashed utterly the tendons on both sides
with the bones, and he was hurled into the dust backwards
reaching out both hands to his own beloved companions,
gasping life out; the stone's thrower ran up beside him,
Peiros, and stabbed with his spear next the navel, and all his guts poured
out on the ground, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.
Thoas the Aitolian hit Peiros as he ran backward
with the spear in the chest above the nipple, and the bronze point fixed
in the lung, and Thoas standing close dragged out the heavy
spear from his chest, and drawing his sharp sword struck him
in the middle of the belly, and so took the life from him,
yet did not strip his armour, for his companions about him
stood, Thracians with hair grown at the top, gripping their long spears,
and though he was a mighty man and a strong and proud one
thrust him from them so that he gave ground backward, staggering.
So in the dust these two lay sprawled beside one another,
lords, the one of the Thracians, the other of the bronze-armoured
Epeians; and many others beside were killed all about them.
There no more could a man who was in that work make light of it,
one who still unhit and still unstabbed by the sharp bronze
spun in the midst of that fighting, with Pallas Athene's hold on
his hand guiding him, driving back the volleying spears thrown.
For on that day many men of the Achaians and Trojans
lay sprawled in the dust face downward beside one another.
