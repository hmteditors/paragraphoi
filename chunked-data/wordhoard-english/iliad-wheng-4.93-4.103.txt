'Wise son of Lykaon, would you now let me persuade you?
So you might dare send a flying arrow against Menelaos
and win you glory and gratitude in the sight of all Trojans,
particularly beyond all else with prince Alexandros.
Beyond all beside you would carry away glorious gifts from him,
were he to see warlike Menelaos, the son of Atreus,
struck down by your arrow, and laid on the sorrowful corpse-fire.
Come then, let go an arrow against haughty Menelaos,
but make your prayer to Apollo the light-born, the glorious archer,
that you will accomplish a grand sacrifice of lambs first born
when you come home again to the city of sacred Zeleia.'
