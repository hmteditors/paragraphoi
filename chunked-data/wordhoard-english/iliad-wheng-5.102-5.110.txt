'Rise up, Trojans, o high-hearted, lashers of horses.
Now the best of the Achaians is hit, and I think that he will not
long hold up under the strong arrow, if truly Apollo
lord and son of Zeus stirred me to come forth from Lykia.'
So he spoke, vaunting, but the swift arrow had not broken him,
only he drew back again to his chariot and horses,
and stood there, speaking to Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus:
'Come, dear friend, son of Kapaneus, step down from the chariot,
so that you may pull out from my shoulder this bitter arrow.'
