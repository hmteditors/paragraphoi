'Hear me now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis:
if ever before in kindliness you stood by my father
through the terror of fighting, be my friend now also, Athene;
grant me that I may kill this man and come within spearcast,
who shot me before I could see him, and now boasts over me, saying
I cannot live to look much longer on the shining sunlight.'
