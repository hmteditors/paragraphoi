She spoke thus, grey-eyed Athene, and went, while Tydeus'
son closed once again with the champions, taking his place there;
raging as he had been before to fight with the Trojans,
now the strong rage tripled took hold of him, as of a lion
whom the shepherd among his fleecy flocks in the wild lands
grazed as he leapt the fence of the fold, but has not killed him,
but only stirred up the lion's strength, and can no more fight him
off, but hides in the steading, and the frightened sheep are forsaken,
and these are piled pell-mell on each other in heaps, while the lion
raging still leaps out again over the fence of the deep yard;
such was the rage of strong Diomedes as he closed with the Trojans.
Next he killed Astynoös and Hypeiron, shepherd of the people,
striking one with the bronze-heeled spear above the nipple,
and cutting the other beside the shoulder through the collar-bone
with the great sword, so that neck and back were hewn free of the shoulder.
He left these men, and went on after Polyidos and Abas,
sons of the aged dream-interpreter, Eurydamas;
yet for these two as they went forth the old man did not answer
their dreams, but Diomedes the powerful slew them. Now he
went after the two sons of Phainops, Xanthos and Thoön,
full grown both, but Phainops was stricken in sorrowful old age
nor could breed another son to leave among his possessions.
There he killed these two and took away the dear life from them
both, leaving to their father lamentation and sorrowful
affliction, since he was not to welcome them home from the fighting
alive still; and remoter kinsmen shared his possessions.
Next he killed two children of Dardanian Priam
who were in a single chariot, Echemmon and Chromios.
