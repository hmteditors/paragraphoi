'Keep yourself, Aineias, the reins and your horses. These will
carry better the curved chariot under the driver
they know best, if we must give way before the son of Tydeus;
for fear they might go wild with terror and not be willing
to carry us out of the fighting, as they listen and long for your voice,
for fear the son of high-hearted Tydeus charging upon us
might kill us both and drive away the single-foot horses.
Rather drive yourself your own horses and your own chariot
while with my sharp spear I encounter this man as he comes on.'
