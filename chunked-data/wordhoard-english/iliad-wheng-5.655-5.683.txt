So spoke Sarpedon, while the other lifted his ash spear,
Tlepolemos; and in a single moment the long shafts
shot from their hands, Sarpedon striking him in the middle
of the throat, and the agonizing spear drove clean through
and over his eyes was mantled the covering mist of darkness.
But Tlepolemos in turn had struck Sarpedon with the long spear
in the left thigh, and the spear smashed on through in fury
scraping the bone, but his father fended destruction away from him.
But his brilliant companions carried godlike Sarpedon

but now he pondered two ways within, in mind and in spirit,
whether first to go after the son of Zeus the loud-thundering

who strode out among the champions helmed in the bright bronze
bringing terror to the Danaans; but Zeus' son, Sarpedon,
was glad as he saw him come up, and piteously bespoke him:
