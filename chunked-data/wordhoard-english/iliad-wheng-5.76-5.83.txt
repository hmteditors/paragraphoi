Eurypylos, Euaimon's son, killed brilliant Hypsenor,
son of high-hearted Dolopion, he who was made Skamandros'
priest, and was honoured about the countryside as a god is.
This man Eurypylos, the shining son of Euaimon,
running in chase as he fled before him struck in the shoulder
with a blow swept from the sword and cut the arm's weight from him,
so that the arm dropped bleeding to the ground, and the red death
and destiny the powerful took hold of both eyes.
