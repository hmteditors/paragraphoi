'Father Zeus, are you not angry looking on these acts of violence?
We who are gods forever have to endure the most horrible
hurts, by each other's hatred, as we try to give favour to mortals.
It is your fault we fight, since you brought forth this maniac daughter
accursed, whose mind is fixed forever on unjust action.
For all the rest, as many as are gods on Olympos,
are obedient to you, and we all have rendered ourselves submissive.
Yet you say nothing and you do nothing to check this girl, letting
her go free, since yourself you begot this child of perdition.
See now, the son of Tydeus, Diomedes the haughty,
she has egged on to lash out in fury against the immortal
gods. First he stabbed the Kyprian in the arm by the wrist. Then
like something more than human he swept on even against me.
But my swift feet took me out of the way. Otherwise I should
long be lying there in pain among the stark dead men,
or go living without strength because of the strokes of the bronze spear.'
