Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:
'Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced liar.
To me you are most hateful of all gods who hold Olympos.
Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, was and battles.
Truly the anger of Hera your mother is grown out of all hand
nor gives ground; and try as I may I am broken by her arguments,
and it is by her impulse, I think, you are suffering all this.
And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, since
you are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.
But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinous
long since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky.'
