'Menelaos, beloved of God, you are mad; you have no need
to take leave of your senses thus. Hold fast, though it hurts you,
nor long in your pride to fight with a man who is better than you are,
with Hektor, Priam's son. There are others who shudder before him.
Even Achilleus, in the fighting where men win glory,
trembles to meet this man, and he is far better than you are.
Go back now and sit down in the throng of your own companions;
the Achaians will set up another to fight against this man,
and even though he is without fear, and can never be glutted
with rough work, I think he will be glad to leave off, even
if he comes off whole from the hateful fighting and bitter combat.'
