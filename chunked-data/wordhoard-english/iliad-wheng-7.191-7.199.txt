'See, friends, the lot is mine, and I myself am made happy
in my heart, since I think I can win over brilliant Hektor.
Do this, then: while I put on my armour of fighting,
all of you be praying to the lord Zeus, the son of Kronos,
in silence and each to himself, let none of the Trojans hear you;
or openly out loud, since we have nothing to be afraid of
at all, since no man by force will beat me backward unwilling
as he wills, nor by craft either, since I think that the man who was born
and raised in Salamis, myself, is not such a novice.'
