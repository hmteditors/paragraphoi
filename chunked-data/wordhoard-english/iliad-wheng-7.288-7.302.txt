seeing that God has given you strength, stature and wisdom
also, and with the spear you surpass the other Achaians,
let us now give over this fighting and hostility
for today; we shall fight again, until the divinity
chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.
Night darkens now. It is a good thing to give way to the night-time.
Thus you may bring joy to all the Achaians beside their
ships, and above all to those who are your own kindred and company;
and I in the great city of lord Priam will gladden
the Trojans, and the women of Troy with their trailing robes, who
will go before the divine assembly in thanksgiving for my sake.
Come then, let us give each other glorious presents,
so that any of the Achaians or Trojans may say of us:
"These two fought each other in heart-consuming hate, then
joined with each other in close friendship, before they were parted."'
