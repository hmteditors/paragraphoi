'Worker from afar, thus let it be. These were my thoughts also
as I came down from Olympos among the Achaians and Trojans.
Tell me then, how are you minded to stop these men in their fighting?'
Now in turn the son of Zeus, lord Apollo, addressed her:
'Let us rouse up the strong heart in Hektor, breaker of horses,
if he might call forth some Danaan to do battle against him,
single man against single man, in bitter combat;
and let the strong-greaved Achaians, stirred into admiration,
send forth a single man to do battle with brilliant Hektor.'
He spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess grey-eyed Athene.
Now Helenos, Priam's beloved son, gathered into his heart their
deliberation, and all that pleased the musing divinities.
He went on his way and stood beside Hektor and spoke a word to him:
'Hektor, o son of Priam and equal of Zeus in counsel,
would you now be persuaded by me, for I am your brother?
Make the rest of the Trojans sit down, and all the Achaians,
and yourself call forth one of the Achaians, their bravest,
to fight man to man against you in bitter combat.
Since it is not your destiny yet to die and encounter
fate. For thus I heard it in the speech of the gods everlasting.'
