So he spoke, and they listened to him with care, and obeyed him;
and so took their supper, watch succeeding watch, through the army.
Then at dawn Idaios went down to the hollow ships, where
he found the Danaans, henchmen of the war god, in assembly
beside the stern of Agamemnon's ship; the herald
with the great voice took his stand in their midst, and spoke to them:
'Son of Atreus, and you other great men of all the Achaians,
Priam and the rest of the haughty Trojans have bidden me
give you, if this message be found to your pleasure and liking,
the word of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen.
All those possessions that Alexandros carried in his hollow
ships to Troy, and I wish that he had perished before then,
he is willing to give all back, and to add to these from his own goods.
But the very wedded wife of glorious Menelaos
he says that he will not give, though the Trojans would have him do it.
They told me to give you this message also, if you are willing;
to stop the sorrowful fighting until we can burn the bodies
of our dead. We shall fight again afterwards, until the divinity
chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.'
