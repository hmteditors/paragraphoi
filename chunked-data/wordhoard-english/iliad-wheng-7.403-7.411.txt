So he spoke, and all sons of the Achaians shouted
acclaim for the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses;
and now powerful Agamemnon spoke to Idaios:
'Idaios, you hear for yourself the word of the Achaians,
how they are answering you; and such is my pleasure also.
But about the burning of the dead bodies I do not begrudge you;
no, for there is no sparing time for the bodies of the perished,
once they have died, to give them swiftly the pity of burning.
Let Zeus, high-thundering lord of Hera, witness our pledges.'
