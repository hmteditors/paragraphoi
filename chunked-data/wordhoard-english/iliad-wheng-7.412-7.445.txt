He spoke, and held up the sceptre in the sight of all the gods. Then
Idaios made his way back once more to sacred Ilion.
The Trojans and Dardanians were in session of assembly,
all gathered in one place, awaiting Idaios when he might come
back; and he returned to them and delivered his message
standing there in their midst, and they made their swift preparations,
for two things, some to gather the bodies, and the others firewood;
while the Argives on the other side from their strong-benched vessels
went forward, some to gather the bodies, and others firewood.
Now the sun of a new day struck on the ploughlands, rising
out of the quiet water and the deep stream of the ocean
to climb the sky. The Trojans assembled together. They found
it hard to recognize each individual dead man;
but with water they washed away the blood that was on them
and as they wept warm tears they lifted them on to the wagons.
But great Priam would not let them cry out; and in silence
they piled the bodies upon the pyre, with their hearts in sorrow,
and burned them upon the fire, and went back to sacred Ilion.
In the same way on the other side the strong-greaved Achaians
piled their own slain upon the pyre, with their hearts in sorrow,
and burned them upon the fire, and went-back to their hollow vessels.
But when the dawn was not yet, but still the pallor of night's edge,
a chosen body of the Achaians formed by the pyre;
and they gathered together and piled one single mound all above it
indiscriminately from the plain, and built a fort on it
with towered ramparts, to be a defence for themselves and their vessels;
and they built within these walls gates strongly fitted
that there might be a way through them for the driving of horses;
and on the outer side and against it they dug a deep ditch,
making it great and wide, and fixed the sharp stakes inside it.
So the flowing-haired Achaians laboured, and meanwhile
the gods in session at the side of Zeus who handles the lightning
watched the huge endeavour of the bronze-armoured Achaians;
and the god Poseidon who shakes the earth began speaking among them:
