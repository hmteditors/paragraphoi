'Listen to me, you Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians,
while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.
Zeus, son of Kronos, who sits on high, would not bring to fulfilment
our oaths, but is found to be of evil intention toward both sides
until that day when you storm Troy of the strong towers, or that day
when you yourselves are broken beside your seafaring vessels.
Seeing now that among you are the bravest of all the Achaians,
let one of you, whose heart stirs him to combat against me,
stand forth before all to fight by himself against brilliant Hektor.
Behold the terms that I make, let Zeus be witness upon them.
If with the thin edge of the bronze he takes my life, then
let him strip my armour and carry it back to the hollow ships,
but give my body to be taken home again, so that the Trojans
and the wives of the Trojans may give me in death my rite of burning.
But if I take his life, and Apollo grants me the glory,
I will strip his armour and carry it to sacred Ilion
and hang it in front of the temple of far-striking Apollo,
but his corpse I will give back among the strong-benched vessels
so that the flowing-haired Achaians may give him due burial
and heap up a mound upon him beside the broad passage of Helle.
And some day one of the men to come will say, as he sees it,
one who in his benched ship sails on the wine-blue water:
"This is the mound of a man who died long ago in battle,
who was one of the bravest, and glorious Hektor killed him."
