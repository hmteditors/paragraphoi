'Ah me! You brave in words, you women, not men, of Achaia!
This will be a defilement upon us, shame upon shame piled,
if no one of the Danaans goes out to face Hektor.
No, may all of you turn to water and earth, all of you
who sit by yourselves with no life in you, utterly dishonoured.
I myself will arm against this man. While above us
the threads of victory are held in the hands of the immortals.'
