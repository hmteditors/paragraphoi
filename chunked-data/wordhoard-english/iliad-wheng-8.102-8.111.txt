in very truth these young fighters are too much for you,
and all your strength is gone, and hard old age is upon you,
your henchman is a man of no worth, and your horses are heavy.
Come then, climb into my chariot, so that you may see
what the Trojan horses are like, how they understand their
plain, and how to traverse it in rapid pursuit and withdrawal;
horses I took away from Aineias, who strikes men to terror.
Let the henchmen look after your horses now, while we two
steer these against the Trojans, breakers of horses, so Hektor
even may know if my spear also rages in my hands' grip.'
