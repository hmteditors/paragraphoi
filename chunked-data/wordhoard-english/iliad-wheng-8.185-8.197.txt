'Xanthos and you, Podargos, Aithon and Lampos the shining,
now repay me for all that loving care in abundance
Andromache the daughter of high-hearted EÃ«tion
gave you: the sweet-hearted wheat before all the others
and mixed wine with it for you to drink, when her heart inclined to it,
as for me, who am proud that I am her young husband.
Follow close now and be rapid, so we may capture
the shield of Nestor, whose high fame goes up to the sky now,
how it is all of gold, the shield itself and the cross-rods;
and strip from the shoulders of Diomedes, breaker of horses,
that elaborate corselet that Hephaistos wrought with much toil.
Could we capture these two things, I might hope the Achaians
might embark this very night on their fast-running vessels.'
