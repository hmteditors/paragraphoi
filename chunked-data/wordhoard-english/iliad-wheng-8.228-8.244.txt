'Shame, you Argives, poor nonentities splendid to look on.
Where are our high words gone, when we said that we were the bravest?
those words you spoke before all in hollow vaunting at Lemnos
when you were filled with abundant meat of the high-horned oxen
and drank from the great bowls filled to the brim with wine, how each man
could stand up against a hundred or even two hundred Trojans
in the fighting; now we together cannot match one of them,
Hektor, who must presently kindle our ships with the hot fire.
Father Zeus, is it one of our too strong kings you have stricken
in this disaster now, and stripped him of his high honour?
For I say that never did I pass by your fair-wrought altar
in my benched ships when I came here on this desperate journey;
but on all altars I burned the fat and the thighs of oxen
in my desire to sack the strong-walled city of the Trojans.
Still, Zeus, bring to pass at least this thing that I pray for.
Let our men at least get clear and escape, and let not
the Achaians be thus beaten down at the hands of the Trojans.'
