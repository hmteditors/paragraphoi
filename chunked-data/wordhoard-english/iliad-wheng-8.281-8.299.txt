'Telamonian Teukros, dear heart, o lord of your people,
strike so; thus you may be a light given to the Danaans,
and to Telamon your father, who cherished you when you were little,
and, bastard as you were, looked after you in his own house.
Bring him into glory, though he is far away; and for my part,
I will tell you this, and it will be a thing accomplished:
if ever Zeus who holds the aegis and Athene grant me
to sack outright the strong-founded citadel of Ilion,
first after myself I will put into your hands some great gift
of honour; a tripod, or two horses and the chariot with them,
or else a woman, who will go up into the same bed with you.'
Then in answer to him again spoke Teukros the blameless:
'Son of Atreus, most lordly: must you then drive me, who am eager
myself, as it is? Never, so far as the strength is in me,
have I stopped, since we began driving the Trojans back upon Ilion;
since then I have been lurking here with my bow, to strike down
fighters. And by this I have shot eight long-flanged arrows,
and all of them were driven into the bodies of young men,
fighters; yet still I am not able to hit this mad dog.'
