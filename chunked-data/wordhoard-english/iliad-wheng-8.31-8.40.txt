'Son of Kronos, our father, o lordliest of the mighty,
we know already your strength and how none can stand up against it.
Yet even so we are sorrowful for the Danaan spearmen
who must fill out an unhappy destiny, and perish.
Still we shall keep out of the fighting, as you command us;
yet we will put good counsel in the Argives; if it may help them,
so that not all of them will die because of your anger.'
Then Zeus the gatherer of the clouds smiled at her and answered:
'Tritogeneia, dear daughter, do not lose heart; for I say this
not in outright anger, and my meaning toward you is kindly.'
