'Where so furious? How can your hearts so storm within you?
The son of Kronos will not let you stand by the Argives.
Since Zeus has uttered this threat and will make it a thing accomplished:
that he will lame beneath the harness your fast-running horses,
and hurl yourselves from the driver's place, and smash your chariot;
and not in the circle of ten returning years would you be whole
of the wounds where the stroke of the lightning hits you; so that
you may know, grey-eyed goddess, when it is your father you fight with.
Yes, you, bold brazen wench, are audacious indeed, if truly
you dare to lift up your gigantic spear in the face of your father.
Yet with Hera he is not so angry, neither indignant,
since it is ever her way to cross the commands he gives her.'
