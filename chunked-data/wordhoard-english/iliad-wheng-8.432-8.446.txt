So she spoke, and turned back again her single-foot horses,
and the Hours set free their flowing-maned horses from the harness,
and tethered them at their mangers that were piled with ambrosia
and leaned the chariot against the shining inward wall. Meanwhile
the goddesses themselves took their place on the golden couches
among the other immortals, their hearts deep grieving within them.
Now father Zeus steered back from Ida his strong-wheeled chariot
and horses to Olympos, and came among the gods' sessions,
while for him the famed shaker of the earth set free his horses,
and put the chariot on its stand, with a cloth spread over it.
Then Zeus himself of the wide brows took his place on the golden
throne, as underneath his feet tall Olympos was shaken.
These two alone, Hera and Athene, stayed seated apart aside
from Zeus, and would not speak to him, nor ask him a question;
but he knew the whole matter within his heart, and spoke to them.
