'Why then are you two sorrowful, Athene and Hera?
Surely in the battle where men win glory you were not wearied
out, destroying those Trojans on whom you have set your grim wrath.
In the whole account, such is my strength and my hand so invincible,
not all the gods who are on Olympos could turn me backward,
but before this the trembling took hold of your shining bodies,
before you could look upon the fighting and war's work of sorrow;
for I will say straight out, and it would now be a thing accomplished:
once hit in your car by the lightning stroke you could never
have come back to Olympos, where is the place of the immortals.'
