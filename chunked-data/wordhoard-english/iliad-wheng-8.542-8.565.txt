So Hektor spoke among them, and the Trojans shouted approval.
And they set free their sweating horses from under the harness
and tethered them by the reins, each one by his own chariot.
They led forth also out of the city oxen and fat sheep
in all speed, and conveyed out also the kindly sweet wine,
with food out of their houses, and heaped many piles of firewood.
They accomplished likewise full sacrifices before the immortals,
and the winds wafted the savour aloft from the plain to the heavens
in its fragrance; and yet the blessed gods took no part of it.
They would not; so hateful to them was sacred Ilion,
and Priam, and the city of Priam of the strong ash spear.
So with hearts made high these sat night-long by the outworks
of battle, and their watchfires blazed numerous about them.
As when in the sky the stars about the moon's shining
are seen in all their glory, when the air has fallen to stillness,
and all the high places of the hills are clear, and the shoulders out-jutting,
and the deep ravines, as endless bright air spills from the heavens
and all the stars are seen, to make glad the heart of the shepherd;
such in their numbers blazed the watchfires the Trojans were burning
between the waters of Xanthos and the ships, before Ilion.
A thousand fires were burning there in the plain, and beside each
one sat fifty men in the flare of the blazing firelight.
And standing each beside his chariot, champing white barley
and oats, the horses waited for the dawn to mount to her high place.
