So he spoke, and they listened hard to him, and obeyed him,
and the sentries went forth rapidly in their armour, gathering
about Nestor's son Thrasymedes, shepherd of the people,
and about Askalaphos and Ialmenos, sons both of Ares,
about Meriones and Aphareus and De√Øpyros
and about the son of Kreion, Lykomedes the brilliant.
There were seven leaders of the sentinels, and with each one a hundred
fighting men followed gripping in their hands the long spears.
They took position in the space between the ditch and the rampart,
and there they kindled their fires and each made ready his supper.
