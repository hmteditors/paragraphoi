	<p id="IL.1.1">SING, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.1.2">and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.3">hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls</p>
	<p id="IL.1.4">of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting</p>
	<p id="IL.1.5">of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished</p>
	<p id="IL.1.6">since that time when first there stood in division of conflict</p>
	<p id="IL.1.7">Atreus' son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.8">What god was it then set them together in bitter collision?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.9">Zeus' son and Leto's, Apollo, who in anger at the king drove</p>
	<p id="IL.1.10">the foul pestilence along the host, and the people perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.11">since Atreus' son had dishonoured Chryses, priest of Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.12">when he came beside the fast ships of the Achaians to ransom</p>
	<p id="IL.1.13">back his daughter, carrying gifts beyond count and holding</p>
	<p id="IL.1.14">in his hands wound on a staff of gold the ribbons of Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.1.15">who strikes from afar, and supplicated all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.16">but above all Atreus' two sons, the marshals of the people:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.17">'Sons of Atreus and you other strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.18">to you may the gods grant who have their homes on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.1.19">Priam's city to be plundered and a fair homecoming thereafter,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.20">but may you give me back my own daughter and take the ransom,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.21">giving honour to Zeus' son who strikes from afar, Apollo.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.22">Then all the rest of the Achaians cried out in favour</p>
	<p id="IL.1.23">that the priest be respected and the shining ransom be taken;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.24">yet this pleased not the heart of Atreus' son Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.25">but harshly he drove him away with a strong order upon him:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.26">'Never let me find you again, old sir, near our hollow</p>
	<p id="IL.1.27">ships, neither lingering now nor coming again hereafter,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.28">for fear your staff and the god's ribbons help you no longer.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.29">The girl I will not give back; sooner will old age come upon her</p>
	<p id="IL.1.30">in my own house, in Argos, far from her own land, going</p>
	<p id="IL.1.31">up and down by the loom and being in my bed as my companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.32">So go now, do not make me angry; so you will be safer.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.33">So he spoke, and the old man in terror obeyed him</p>
	<p id="IL.1.34">and went silently away beside the murmuring sea beach.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.35">Over and over the old man prayed as he walked in solitude</p>
	<p id="IL.1.36">to King Apollo, whom Leto of the lovely hair bore: 'Hear me,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.37">lord of the silver bow who set your power about Chryse</p>
	<p id="IL.1.38">and Killa the sacrosanct, who are lord in strength over Tenedos,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.39">Smintheus, if ever it pleased your heart that I built your temple,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.40">if ever it pleased you that I burned all the rich thigh pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.1.41">of bulls, of goats, then bring to pass this wish I pray for:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.42">let your arrows make the Danaans pay for my tears shed.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.43">So he spoke in prayer, and Phoibos Apollo heard him,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.44">and strode down along the pinnacles of Olympos, angered</p>
	<p id="IL.1.45">in his heart, carrying across his shoulders the bow and the hooded</p>
	<p id="IL.1.46">quiver; and the shafts clashed on the shoulders of the god walking</p>
	<p id="IL.1.47">angrily. He came as night comes down and knelt then</p>
	<p id="IL.1.48">apart and opposite the ships and let go an arrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.49">Terrible was the clash that rose from the bow of silver.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.50">First he went after the mules and the circling hounds, then let go</p>
	<p id="IL.1.51">a tearing arrow against the men themselves and struck them.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.52">The corpse fires burned everywhere and did not stop burning.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.53">Nine days up and down the host ranged the god's arrows,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.54">but on the tenth Achilleus called the people to assembly;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.55">a thing put into his mind by the goddess of the white arms, Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.56">who had pity upon the Danaans when she saw them dying.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.57">Now when they were all assembled in one place together,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.58">Achilleus of the swift feet stood up among them and spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.59">'Son of Atreus, I believe now that straggling backwards</p>
	<p id="IL.1.60">we must make our way home if we can even escape death,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.61">if fighting now must crush the Achaians and the plague likewise.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.62">No, come, let us ask some holy man, some prophet,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.63">even an interpreter of dreams, since a dream also</p>
	<p id="IL.1.64">comes from Zeus, who can tell why Phoibos Apollo is so angry,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.65">if for the sake of some vow, some hecatomb he blames us,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.66">if given the fragrant smoke of lambs, of he goats, somehow</p>
	<p id="IL.1.67">he can be made willing to beat the bane aside from us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.68">He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them stood up</p>
	<p id="IL.1.69">Kalchas, Thestor's son, far the best of the bird interpreters,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.70">who knew all things that were, the things to come and the things past,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.71">who guided into the land of Ilion the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.1.72">through that seercraft of his own that Phoibos Apollo gave him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.73">He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.74">'You have bidden me, Achilleus beloved of Zeus, to explain to</p>
	<p id="IL.1.75">you this anger of Apollo the lord who strikes from afar. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.1.76">I will speak; yet make me a promise and swear before me</p>
	<p id="IL.1.77">readily by word and work of your hands to defend me,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.78">since I believe I shall make a man angry who holds great kingship</p>
	<p id="IL.1.79">over the men of Argos, and all the Achaians obey him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.80">For a king when he is angry with a man beneath him is too strong,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.81">and suppose even for the day itself he swallow down his anger,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.82">he still keeps bitterness that remains until its fulfilment</p>
	<p id="IL.1.83">deep in his chest. Speak forth then, tell me if you will protect me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.84">Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.85">'Speak, interpreting whatever you know, and fear nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.86">In the name of Apollo beloved of Zeus to whom you, Kalchas,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.87">make your prayers when you interpret the gods' will to the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.88">no man so long as I am alive above earth and see daylight</p>
	<p id="IL.1.89">shall lay the weight of his hands on you beside the hollow ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.90">not one of all the Danaans, even if you mean Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.91">who now claims to be far the greatest of all the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.92">At this the blameless seer took courage again and spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.93">'No, it is not for the sake of some vow or hecatomb he blames us,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.94">but for the sake of his priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured</p>
	<p id="IL.1.95">and would not give him back his daughter nor accept the ransom.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.96">Therefore the archer sent griefs against us and will send them</p>
	<p id="IL.1.97">still, nor sooner thrust back the shameful plague from the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.1.98">until we give the glancing-eyed girl back to her father</p>
	<p id="IL.1.99">without price, without ransom, and lead also a blessed hecatomb</p>
	<p id="IL.1.100">to Chryse; thus we might propitiate and persuade him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.101">He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them stood up</p>
	<p id="IL.1.102">Atreus' son the hero wide-ruling Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.1.103">raging, the heart within filled black to the brim with anger</p>
	<p id="IL.1.104">from beneath, but his two eyes showed like fire in their blazing.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.105">First of all he eyed Kalchas bitterly and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.106">'Seer of evil: never yet have you told me a good thing.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.107">Always the evil things are dear to your heart to prophesy,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.108">but nothing excellent have you said nor ever accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.109">Now once more you make divination to the Danaans, argue</p>
	<p id="IL.1.110">forth your reason why he who strikes from afar afflicts them,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.111">because I for the sake of the girl Chryseis would not take</p>
	<p id="IL.1.112">the shining ransom; and indeed I wish greatly to have her</p>
	<p id="IL.1.113">in my own house; since I like her better than Klytaimestra</p>
	<p id="IL.1.114">my own wife, for in truth she is no way inferior,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.115">neither in build nor stature nor wit, not in accomplishment.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.116">Still I am willing to give her back, if such is the best way.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.117">I myself desire that my people be safe, not perish.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.118">Find me then some prize that shall be my own, lest I only</p>
	<p id="IL.1.119">among the Argives go without, since that were unfitting;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.120">you are all witnesses to this thing, that my prize goes elsewhere.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.121">Then in answer again spoke brilliant swift-footed Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.122">'Son of Atreus, most lordly, greediest for gain of all men,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.123">how shall the great-hearted Achaians give you a prize now?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.124">There is no great store of things lying about I know of.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.125">But what we took from the cities by storm has been distributed;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.126">it is unbecoming for the people to call back things once given.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.127">No, for the present give the girl back to the god; we Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.1.128">thrice and four times over will repay you, if ever Zeus gives</p>
	<p id="IL.1.129">into our hands the strong-walled citadel of Troy to be plundered.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.130">Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.131">'Not that way, good fighter though you be, godlike Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.132">strive to cheat, for you will not deceive, you will not persuade me.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.133">What do you want? To keep your own prize and have me sit here</p>
	<p id="IL.1.134">lacking one? Are you ordering me to give this girl back?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.135">Either the great-hearted Achaians shall give me a new prize</p>
	<p id="IL.1.136">chosen according to my desire to atone for the girl lost,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.137">or else if they will not give me one I myself shall take her,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.138">your own prize, or that of Aias, or that of Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.139">going myself in person; and he whom I visit will be bitter.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.140">Still, these are things we shall deliberate again hereafter.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.141">Come, now, we must haul a black ship down to the bright sea,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.142">and assemble rowers enough for it, and put on board it</p>
	<p id="IL.1.143">the hecatomb, and the girl herself, Chryseis of the fair cheeks,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.144">and let there be one responsible man in charge of her,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.145">either Aias or Idomeneus or brilliant Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.146">or you yourself, son of Peleus, most terrifying of all men,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.147">to reconcile by accomplishing sacrifice the archer.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.148">Then looking darkly at him Achilleus of the swift feet spoke:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.149">'O wrapped in shamelessness, with your mind forever on profit,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.150">how shall any one of the Achaians readily obey you</p>
	<p id="IL.1.151">either to go on a journey or to fight men strongly in battle?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.152">I for my part did not come here for the sake of the Trojan</p>
	<p id="IL.1.153">spearmen to fight against them, since to me they have done nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.154">Never yet have they driven away my cattle or my horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.155">never in Phthia where the soil is rich and men grow great did they</p>
	<p id="IL.1.156">spoil my harvest, since indeed there is much that lies between us,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.157">the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea; but for your sake,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.158">o great shamelessness, we followed, to do you favour,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.159">you with the dog's eyes, to win your honour and Menelaos'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.160">from the Trojans. You forget all this or else you care nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.161">And now my prize you threaten in person to strip from me,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.162">for whom I laboured much, the gift of the sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.163">Never, when the Achaians sack some well-founded citadel</p>
	<p id="IL.1.164">of the Trojans, do I have a prize that is equal to your prize.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.165">Always the greater part of the painful fighting is the work of</p>
	<p id="IL.1.166">my hands; but when the time comes to distribute the booty</p>
	<p id="IL.1.167">yours is far the greater reward, and I with some small thing</p>
	<p id="IL.1.168">yet dear to me go back to my ships when I am weary with fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.169">Now I am returning to Phthia, since it is much better</p>
	<p id="IL.1.170">to go home again with my curved ships, and I am minded no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.1.171">to stay here dishonoured and pile up your wealth and your luxury.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.172">Then answered him in turn the lord of men Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.173">'Run away by all means if your heart drives you. I will not</p>
	<p id="IL.1.174">entreat you to stay here for my sake. There are others with me</p>
	<p id="IL.1.175">who will do me honour, and above all Zeus of the counsels.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.176">To me you are the most hateful of all the kings whom the gods love.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.177">Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, and wars and battles;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.178">and if you are very strong indeed, that is a god's gift.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.179">Go home then with your own ships and your own companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.180">be king over the Myrmidons. I care nothing about you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.181">I take no account of your anger. But here is my threat to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.182">Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.183">I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own</p>
	<p id="IL.1.184">followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.185">your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well</p>
	<p id="IL.1.186">how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back</p>
	<p id="IL.1.187">from likening himself to me and contending against me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.188">So he spoke. And the anger came on Peleus' son, and within</p>
	<p id="IL.1.189">his shaggy breast the heart was divided two ways, pondering</p>
	<p id="IL.1.190">whether to draw from beside his thigh the sharp sword, driving</p>
	<p id="IL.1.191">away all those who stood between and kill the son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.192">or else to check the spleen within and keep down his anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.193">Now as he weighed in mind and spirit these two courses</p>
	<p id="IL.1.194">and was drawing from its scabbard the great sword, Athene descended</p>
	<p id="IL.1.195">from the sky. For Hera the goddess of the white arms sent her,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.196">who loved both men equally in her heart and cared for them.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.197">The goddess standing behind Peleus' son caught him by the fair hair,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.198">appearing to him only, for no man of the others saw her.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.199">Achilleus in amazement turned about, and straightway</p>
	<p id="IL.1.200">knew Pallas Athene and the terrible eyes shining.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.201">He uttered winged words and addressed her: 'Why have you come now,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.202">o child of Zeus of the aegis, once more? Is it that you may see</p>
	<p id="IL.1.203">the outrageousness of the son of Atreus Agamemnon?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.204">Yet will I tell you this thing, and I think it shall be accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.205">By such acts of arrogance he may even lose his own life.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.206">Then in answer the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.207">'I have come down to stay your anger--but will you obey me?--</p>
	<p id="IL.1.208">from the sky; and the goddess of the white arms Hera sent me,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.209">who loves both of you equally in her heart and cares for you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.210">Come then, do not take your sword in your hand, keep clear of fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.211">though indeed with words you may abuse him, and it will be that way.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.212">And this also will I tell you and it will be a thing accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.213">Some day three times over such shining gifts shall be given you</p>
	<p id="IL.1.214">by reason of this outrage. Hold your hand then, and obey us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.215">Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.216">'Goddess, it is necessary that I obey the word of you two,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.217">angry though I am in my heart. So it will be better.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.218">If any man obeys the gods, they listen to him also.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.219">He spoke, and laid his heavy hand on the silver sword hilt</p>
	<p id="IL.1.220">and thrust the great blade back into the scabbard nor disobeyed</p>
	<p id="IL.1.221">the word of Athene. And she went back again to Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.1.222">to the house of Zeus of the aegis with the other divinities.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.223">But Peleus' son once again in words of derision</p>
	<p id="IL.1.224">spoke to Atreides, and did not yet let go of his anger:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.225">'You wine sack, with a dog's eyes, with a deer's heart. Never</p>
	<p id="IL.1.226">once have you taken courage in your heart to arm with your people</p>
	<p id="IL.1.227">for battle, or go into ambuscade with the best of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.228">No, for in such things you see death. Far better to your mind</p>
	<p id="IL.1.229">is it, all along the widespread host of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.1.230">to take away the gifts of any man who speaks up against you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.231">King who feed on your people, since you rule nonentities;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.232">otherwise, son of Atreus, this were your last outrage.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.233">But I will tell you this and swear a great oath upon it:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.234">in the name of this sceptre, which never again will bear leaf nor</p>
	<p id="IL.1.235">branch, now that it has left behind the cut stump in the mountains,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.236">nor shall it ever blossom again, since the bronze blade stripped</p>
	<p id="IL.1.237">bark and leafage, and now at last the sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.1.238">carry it in their hands in state when they administer</p>
	<p id="IL.1.239">the justice of Zeus. And this shall be a great oath before you:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.240">some day longing for Achilleus will come to the sons of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.241">all of them. Then stricken at heart though you be, you will be able</p>
	<p id="IL.1.242">to do nothing, when in their numbers before man-slaughtering Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.1.243">they drop and die. And then you will eat out the heart within you</p>
	<p id="IL.1.244">in sorrow, that you did no honour to the best of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.245">Thus spoke Peleus' son and dashed to the ground the sceptre</p>
	<p id="IL.1.246">studded with golden nails, and sat down again. But Atreides</p>
	<p id="IL.1.247">raged still on the other side, and between them Nestor</p>
	<p id="IL.1.248">the fair-spoken rose up, the lucid speaker of Pylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.249">from whose lips the streams of words ran sweeter than honey.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.250">In his time two generations of mortal men had perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.251">those who had grown up with him and they who had been born to</p>
	<p id="IL.1.252">these in sacred Pylos, and he was king in the third age.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.253">He in kind intention toward both stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.254">'Oh, for shame. Great sorrow comes on the land of Achaia.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.255">Now might Priam and the sons of Priam in truth be happy,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.256">and all the rest of the Trojans be visited in their hearts with gladness,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.257">were they to hear all this wherein you two are quarrelling,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.258">you, who surpass all Danaans in council, in fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.259">Yet be persuaded. Both of you are younger than I am.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.260">Yes, and in my time I have dealt with better men than</p>
	<p id="IL.1.261">you are, and never once did they disregard me. Never</p>
	<p id="IL.1.262">yet have I seen nor shall see again such men as these were,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.263">men like Peirithoös, and Dryas, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.264">Kaineus and Exadios, godlike Polyphemos,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.265">or Theseus, Aigeus' son, in the likeness of the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.266">These were the strongest generation of earth-born mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.267">the strongest, and they fought against the strongest, the beast men</p>
	<p id="IL.1.268">living within the mountains, and terribly they destroyed them.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.269">I was of the company of these men, coming from Pylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.270">a long way from a distant land, since they had summoned me.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.271">And I fought single-handed, yet against such men no one</p>
	<p id="IL.1.272">of the mortals now alive upon earth could do battle. And also</p>
	<p id="IL.1.273">these listened to the counsels I gave and heeded my bidding.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.274">Do you also obey, since to be persuaded is better.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.275">You, great man that you are, yet do not take the girl away</p>
	<p id="IL.1.276">but let her be, a prize as the sons of the Achaians gave her</p>
	<p id="IL.1.277">first. Nor, son of Peleus, think to match your strength with</p>
	<p id="IL.1.278">the king, since never equal with the rest is the portion of honour</p>
	<p id="IL.1.279">of the sceptred king to whom Zeus gives magnificence. Even</p>
	<p id="IL.1.280">though you are the stronger man, and the mother who bore you was immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.281">yet is this man greater who is lord over more than you rule.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.282">Son of Atreus, give up your anger; even I entreat you</p>
	<p id="IL.1.283">to give over your bitterness against Achilleus, he who</p>
	<p id="IL.1.284">stands as a great bulwark of battle over all the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.285">Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.286">'Yes, old sir, all this you have said is fair and orderly.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.287">Yet here is a man who wishes to be above all others,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.288">who wishes to hold power over all, and to be lord of</p>
	<p id="IL.1.289">all, and give them their orders, yet I think one will not obey him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.290">And if the everlasting gods have made him a spearman,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.291">yet they have not given him the right to speak abusively.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.292">Then looking at him darkly brilliant Achilleus answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.293">'So must I be called of no account and a coward</p>
	<p id="IL.1.294">if I must carry out every order you may happen to give me.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.295">Tell other men to do these things, but give me no more</p>
	<p id="IL.1.296">commands, since I for my part have no intention to obey you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.297">And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.298">With my hands I will not fight for the girl's sake, neither</p>
	<p id="IL.1.299">with you nor any other man, since you take her away who gave her.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.300">But of all the other things that are mine beside my fast black</p>
	<p id="IL.1.301">ship, you shall take nothing away against my pleasure.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.302">Come, then, only try it, that these others may see also;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.303">instantly your own black blood will stain my spearpoint.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.304">So these two after battling in words of contention</p>
	<p id="IL.1.305">stood up, and broke the assembly beside the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.306">Peleus' son went back to his balanced ships and his shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.1.307">with Patroklos, Menoitios' son, and his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.308">But the son of Atreus drew a fast ship down to the water</p>
	<p id="IL.1.309">and allotted into it twenty rowers and put on board it</p>
	<p id="IL.1.310">the hecatomb for the god and Chryseis of the fair cheeks</p>
	<p id="IL.1.311">leading her by the hand. And in charge went crafty Odysseus.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.312">These then putting out went over the ways of the water</p>
	<p id="IL.1.313">while Atreus' son told his people to wash off their defilement.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.314">And they washed it away and threw the washings into the salt sea.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.315">Then they accomplished perfect hecatombs to Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.316">of bulls and goats along the beach of the barren salt sea.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.317">The savour of the burning swept in circles up to the bright sky.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.318">Thus these were busy about the army. But Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.1.319">did not give up his anger and the first threat he made to Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.320">but to Talthybios he gave his orders and Eurybates</p>
	<p id="IL.1.321">who were heralds and hard-working henchmen to him: 'Go now</p>
	<p id="IL.1.322">to the shelter of Peleus' son Achilleus, to bring back</p>
	<p id="IL.1.323">Briseis of the fair cheeks leading her by the hand. And if he</p>
	<p id="IL.1.324">will not give her, I must come in person to take her</p>
	<p id="IL.1.325">with many men behind me, and it will be the worse for him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.326">He spoke and sent them forth with this strong order upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.327">They went against their will beside the beach of the barren</p>
	<p id="IL.1.328">salt sea, and came to the shelters and the ships of the Myrmidons.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.329">The man himself they found beside his shelter and his black ship</p>
	<p id="IL.1.330">sitting. And Achilleus took no joy at all when he saw them.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.331">These two terrified and in awe of the king stood waiting</p>
	<p id="IL.1.332">quietly, and did not speak a word at all nor question him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.333">But he knew the whole matter in his own heart, and spoke first:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.334">'Welcome, heralds, messengers of Zeus and of mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.335">Draw near. You are not to blame in my sight, but Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.1.336">who sent the two of you here for the sake of the girl Briseis.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.337">Go then, illustrious Patroklos, and bring the girl forth</p>
	<p id="IL.1.338">and give her to these to be taken away. Yet let them be witnesses</p>
	<p id="IL.1.339">in the sight of the blessed gods, in the sight of mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.1.340">men, and of this cruel king, if ever hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.1.341">there shall be need of me to beat back the shameful destruction</p>
	<p id="IL.1.342">from the rest. For surely in ruinous heart he makes sacrifice</p>
	<p id="IL.1.343">and has not wit enough to look behind and before him</p>
	<p id="IL.1.344">that the Achaians fighting beside their ships shall not perish.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.345">So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.346">He led forth from the hut Briseis of the fair cheeks and gave her</p>
	<p id="IL.1.347">to be taken away; and they walked back beside the ships of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.348">and the woman all unwilling went with them still. But Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.1.349">weeping went and sat in sorrow apart from his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.1.350">beside the beach of the grey sea looking out on the infinite water.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.351">Many times stretching forth his hands he called on his mother:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.352">'Since, my mother, you bore me to be a man with a short life,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.353">therefore Zeus of the loud thunder on Olympos should grant me</p>
	<p id="IL.1.354">honour at least. But now he has given me not even a little.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.355">Now the son of Atreus, powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.356">has dishonoured me, since he has taken away my prize and keeps it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.357">So he spoke in tears and the lady his mother heard him</p>
	<p id="IL.1.358">as she sat in the depths of the sea at the side of her aged father,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.359">and lightly she emerged like a mist from the grey water.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.360">She came and sat beside him as he wept, and stroked him</p>
	<p id="IL.1.361">with her hand and called him by name and spoke to him: 'Why then,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.362">child, do you lament? What sorrow has come to your heart now?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.363">Tell me, do not hide it in your mind, and thus we shall both know.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.364">Sighing heavily Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.365">'You know; since you know why must I tell you all this?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.366">We went against Thebe, the sacred city of Eëtion,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.367">and the city we sacked, and carried everything back to this place,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.368">and the sons of the Achaians made a fair distribution</p>
	<p id="IL.1.369">and for Atreus' son they chose out Chryseis of the fair cheeks.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.370">Then Chryses, priest of him who strikes from afar, Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.371">came beside the fast ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians to ransom</p>
	<p id="IL.1.372">back his daughter, carrying gifts beyond count and holding</p>
	<p id="IL.1.373">in his hands wound on a staff of gold the ribbons of Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.1.374">who strikes from afar, and supplicated all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.375">but above all Atreus' two sons, the marshals of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.376">Then all the rest of the Achaians cried out in favour</p>
	<p id="IL.1.377">that the priest be respected and the shining ransom be taken;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.378">yet this pleased not the heart of Atreus' son Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.379">but harshly he sent him away with a strong order upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.380">The old man went back again in anger, but Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.1.381">listened to his prayer, since he was very dear to him, and let go</p>
	<p id="IL.1.382">the wicked arrow against the Argives. And now the people</p>
	<p id="IL.1.383">were dying one after another while the god's shafts ranged</p>
	<p id="IL.1.384">everywhere along the wide host of the Achaians, till the seer</p>
	<p id="IL.1.385">knowing well the truth interpreted the designs of the archer.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.386">It was I first of all urged then the god's appeasement;</p>
	<p id="IL.1.387">and the anger took hold of Atreus' son, and in speed standing</p>
	<p id="IL.1.388">he uttered his threat against me, and now it is a thing accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.389">For the girl the glancing-eyed Achaians are taking to Chryse</p>
	<p id="IL.1.390">in a fast ship, also carrying to the king presents. But even</p>
	<p id="IL.1.391">now the heralds went away from my shelter leading</p>
	<p id="IL.1.392">Briseus' daughter, whom the sons of the Achaians gave me.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.393">You then, if you have power to, protect your own son, going</p>
	<p id="IL.1.394">to Olympos and supplicating Zeus, if ever before now</p>
	<p id="IL.1.395">either by word you comforted Zeus' heart or by action.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.396">Since it is many times in my father's halls I have heard you</p>
	<p id="IL.1.397">making claims, when you said you only among the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.1.398">beat aside shameful destruction from Kronos' son the dark-misted,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.399">that time when all the other Olympians sought to bind him,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.400">Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. Then you,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.401">goddess, went and set him free from his shackles, summoning</p>
	<p id="IL.1.402">in speed the creature of the hundred hands to tall Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.403">that creature the gods name Briareus, but all men</p>
	<p id="IL.1.404">Aigaios' son, but he is far greater in strength than his father.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.405">He rejoicing in the glory of it sat down by Kronion,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.406">and the rest of the blessed gods were frightened and gave up binding him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.407">Sit beside him and take his knees and remind him of these things</p>
	<p id="IL.1.408">now, if perhaps he might be willing to help the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.409">and pin the Achaians back against the ships and the water,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.410">dying, so that thus they may all have profit of their own king,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.411">that Atreus' son wide-ruling Agamemnon may recognize</p>
	<p id="IL.1.412">his madness, that he did no honour to the best of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.413">Thetis answered him then letting the tears fall: 'Ah me,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.414">my child. Your birth was bitterness. Why did I raise you?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.415">If only you could sit by your ships untroubled, not weeping,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.416">since indeed your lifetime is to be short, of no length.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.417">Now it has befallen that your life must be brief and bitter</p>
	<p id="IL.1.418">beyond all men's. To a bad destiny I bore you in my chambers.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.419">But I will go to cloud-dark Olympos and ask this</p>
	<p id="IL.1.420">thing of Zeus who delights in the thunder. Perhaps he will do it.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.421">Do you therefore continuing to sit by your swift ships</p>
	<p id="IL.1.422">be angry at the Achaians and stay away from all fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.423">For Zeus went to the blameless Aithiopians at the Ocean</p>
	<p id="IL.1.424">yesterday to feast, and the rest of the gods went with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.425">On the twelfth day he will be coming back to Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.426">and then I will go for your sake to the house of Zeus, bronze-founded,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.427">and take him by the knees and I think I can persuade him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.428">So speaking she went away from that place and left him</p>
	<p id="IL.1.429">sorrowing in his heart for the sake of the fair-girdled woman</p>
	<p id="IL.1.430">whom they were taking by force against his will. But Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.1.431">meanwhile drew near to Chryse conveying the sacred hecatomb.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.432">These when they were inside the many-hollowed harbour</p>
	<p id="IL.1.433">took down and gathered together the sails and stowed them in the black ship,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.434">let down mast by the forestays, and settled it into the mast crutch</p>
	<p id="IL.1.435">easily, and rowed her in with oars to the mooring.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.436">They threw over the anchor stones and made fast the stern cables</p>
	<p id="IL.1.437">and themselves stepped out on to the break of the sea beach,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.438">and led forth the hecatomb to the archer Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.439">and Chryseis herself stepped forth from the sea-going vessel.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.440">Odysseus of the many designs guided her to the altar</p>
	<p id="IL.1.441">and left her in her father's arms and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.442">'Chryses, I was sent here by the lord of men Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.1.443">to lead back your daughter and accomplish a sacred hecatomb</p>
	<p id="IL.1.444">to Apollo on behalf of the Danaans, that we may propitiate</p>
	<p id="IL.1.445">the lord who has heaped unhappiness and tears on the Argives.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.446">He spoke, and left her in his arms. And he received gladly</p>
	<p id="IL.1.447">his beloved child. And the men arranged the sacred hecatomb</p>
	<p id="IL.1.448">for the god in orderly fashion around the strong-founded altar.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.449">Next they washed their hands and took up the scattering barley.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.450">Standing among them with lifted arms Chryses prayed in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.451">'Hear me, lord of the silver bow, who set your power about</p>
	<p id="IL.1.452">Chryse and Killa the sacrosanct, who are lord in strength over</p>
	<p id="IL.1.453">Tenedos; if once before you listened to my prayers</p>
	<p id="IL.1.454">and did me honour and smote strongly the host of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.455">so one more time bring to pass the wish that I pray for.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.456">Beat aside at last the shameful plague from the Danaans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.457">So he spoke in prayer, and Phoibos Apollo heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.458">And when all had made prayer and flung down the scattering barley</p>
	<p id="IL.1.459">first they drew back the victims' heads and slaughtered them and skinned them,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.460">and cut away the meat from the thighs and wrapped them in fat,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.461">making a double fold, and laid shreds of flesh upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.462">The old man burned these on a cleft stick and poured the gleaming</p>
	<p id="IL.1.463">wine over, while the young men with forks in their hands stood about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.464">But when they had burned the thigh pieces and tasted the vitals,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.465">they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them</p>
	<p id="IL.1.466">and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.467">Then after they had finished the work and got the feast ready</p>
	<p id="IL.1.468">they feasted, nor was any man's hunger denied a fair portion.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.469">But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.470">the young men filled the mixing bowls with pure wine, passing</p>
	<p id="IL.1.471">a portion to all, when they had offered drink in the goblets.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.472">All day long they propitiated the god with singing,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.473">chanting a splendid hymn to Apollo, these young Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.474">singing to the one who works from afar, who listened in gladness.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.475">Afterwards when the sun went down and darkness came onward</p>
	<p id="IL.1.476">they lay down and slept beside the ship's stern cables.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.477">But when the young Dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.478">they put forth to sea toward the wide camp of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.479">And Apollo who works from afar sent them a favouring stern wind.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.480">They set up the mast again and spread on it the white sails,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.481">and the wind blew into the middle of the sail, and at the cutwater</p>
	<p id="IL.1.482">a blue wave rose and sang strongly as the ship went onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.483">She ran swiftly cutting across the swell her pathway.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.484">But when they had come back to the wide camp of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.1.485">they hauled the black ship up on the mainland, high up</p>
	<p id="IL.1.486">on the sand, and underneath her they fixed the long props.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.487">Afterwards they scattered to their own ships and their shelters.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.488">But that other still sat in anger beside his swift ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.489">Peleus' son divinely born, Achilleus of the swift feet.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.490">Never now would he go to assemblies where men win glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.491">never more into battle, but continued to waste his heart out</p>
	<p id="IL.1.492">sitting there, though he longed always for the clamour and fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.493">But when the twelfth dawn after this day appeared, the gods who</p>
	<p id="IL.1.494">live forever came back to Olympos all in a body</p>
	<p id="IL.1.495">and Zeus led them; nor did Thetis forget the entreaties</p>
	<p id="IL.1.496">of her son, but she emerged from the sea's waves early</p>
	<p id="IL.1.497">in the morning and went up to the tall sky and Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.498">She found Kronos' broad-browed son apart from the others</p>
	<p id="IL.1.499">sitting upon the highest peak of rugged Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.500">She came and sat beside him with her left hand embracing</p>
	<p id="IL.1.501">his knees, but took him underneath the chin with her right hand</p>
	<p id="IL.1.502">and spoke in supplication to lord Zeus son of Kronos:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.503">'Father Zeus, if ever before in word or action</p>
	<p id="IL.1.504">I did you favour among the immortals, now grant what I ask for.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.505">Now give honour to my son short-lived beyond all other</p>
	<p id="IL.1.506">mortals. Since even now the lord of men Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.1.507">dishonours him, who has taken away his prize and keeps it.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.508">Zeus of the counsels, lord of Olympos, now do him honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.509">So long put strength into the Trojans, until the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.1.510">give my son his rights, and his honour is increased among them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.511">She spoke thus. But Zeus who gathers the clouds made no answer</p>
	<p id="IL.1.512">but sat in silence a long time. And Thetis, as she had taken</p>
	<p id="IL.1.513">his knees, clung fast to them and urged once more her question:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.514">'Bend your head and promise me to accomplish this thing,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.515">or else refuse it, you have nothing to fear, that I may know</p>
	<p id="IL.1.516">by how much I am the most dishonoured of all gods.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.517">Deeply disturbed Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.518">'This is a disastrous matter when you set me in conflict</p>
	<p id="IL.1.519">with Hera, and she troubles me with recriminations.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.520">Since even as things are, forever among the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.1.521">she is at me and speaks of how I help the Trojans in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.522">Even so, go back again now, go away, for fear she</p>
	<p id="IL.1.523">see us. I will look to these things that they be accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.524">See then, I will bend my head that you may believe me.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.525">For this among the immortal gods is the mightiest witness</p>
	<p id="IL.1.526">I can give, and nothing I do shall be vain nor revocable</p>
	<p id="IL.1.527">nor a thing unfulfilled when I bend my head in assent to it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.528">He spoke, the son of Kronos, and nodded his head with the dark brows,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.529">and the immortally anointed hair of the great god</p>
	<p id="IL.1.530">swept from his divine head, and all Olympos was shaken.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.531">So these two who had made their plans separated, and Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.1.532">leapt down again from shining Olympos into the sea's depth,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.533">but Zeus went back to his own house, and all the gods rose up</p>
	<p id="IL.1.534">from their chairs to greet the coming of their father, not one had courage</p>
	<p id="IL.1.535">to keep his place as the father advanced, but stood up to greet him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.536">Thus he took his place on the throne; yet Hera was not</p>
	<p id="IL.1.537">ignorant, having seen how he had been plotting counsels</p>
	<p id="IL.1.538">with Thetis the silver-footed, the daughter of the sea's ancient,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.539">and at once she spoke revilingly to Zeus son of Kronos:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.540">'Treacherous one, what god has been plotting counsels with you?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.541">Always it is dear to your heart in my absence to think of</p>
	<p id="IL.1.542">secret things and decide upon them. Never have you patience</p>
	<p id="IL.1.543">frankly to speak forth to me the thing that you purpose.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.544">Then to her the father of gods and men made answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.545">'Hera, do not go on hoping that you will hear all my</p>
	<p id="IL.1.546">thoughts, since these will be too hard for you, though you are my wife.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.547">Any thought that it is right for you to listen to, no one</p>
	<p id="IL.1.548">neither man nor any immortal shall hear it before you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.549">But anything that apart from the rest of the gods I wish to</p>
	<p id="IL.1.550">plan, do not always question each detail nor probe me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.551">Then the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.552">'Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.1.553">Truly too much in time past I have not questioned nor probed you,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.554">but you are entirely free to think out whatever pleases you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.555">Now, though, I am terribly afraid you were won over</p>
	<p id="IL.1.556">by Thetis the silver-footed, the daughter of the sea's ancient.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.557">For early in the morning she sat beside you and took your</p>
	<p id="IL.1.558">knees, and I think you bowed your head in assent to do honour</p>
	<p id="IL.1.559">to Achilleus, and to destroy many beside the ships of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.560">Then in return Zeus who gathers the clouds made answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.561">'Dear lady, I never escape you, you are always full of suspicion.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.562">Yet thus you can accomplish nothing surely, but be more</p>
	<p id="IL.1.563">distant from my heart than ever, and it will be the worse for you.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.564">If what you say is true, then that is the way I wish it.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.565">But go then, sit down in silence, and do as I tell you,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.566">for fear all the gods, as many as are on Olympos, can do nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.1.567">if I come close and lay my unconquerable hands upon you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.568">He spoke, and the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera was frightened</p>
	<p id="IL.1.569">and went and sat down in silence wrenching her heart to obedience,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.570">and all the Uranian gods in the house of Zeus were troubled.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.571">Hephaistos the renowned smith rose up to speak among them,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.572">to bring comfort to his beloved mother, Hera of the white arms:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.573">'This will be a disastrous matter and not endurable</p>
	<p id="IL.1.574">if you two are to quarrel thus for the sake of mortals</p>
	<p id="IL.1.575">and bring brawling among the gods. There will be no pleasure</p>
	<p id="IL.1.576">in the stately feast at all, since vile things will be uppermost.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.577">And I entreat my mother, though she herself understands it,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.578">to be ingratiating toward our father Zeus, that no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.1.579">our father may scold her and break up the quiet of our feasting.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.580">For if the Olympian who handles the lightning should be minded</p>
	<p id="IL.1.581">to hurl us out of our places, he is far too strong for any.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.582">Do you therefore approach him again with words made gentle,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.583">and at once the Olympian will be gracious again to us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.584">He spoke, and springing to his feet put a two-handled goblet</p>
	<p id="IL.1.585">into his mother's hands and spoke again to her once more:</p>
	<p id="IL.1.586">'Have patience, my mother, and endure it, though you be saddened,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.587">for fear that, dear as you are, I see you before my own eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.1.588">struck down, and then sorry though I be I shall not be able</p>
	<p id="IL.1.589">to do anything. It is too hard to fight against the Olympian.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.590">There was a time once before now I was minded to help you,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.591">and he caught me by the foot and threw me from the magic threshold,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.592">and all day long I dropped helpless, and about sunset</p>
	<p id="IL.1.593">I landed in Lemnos, and there was not much life left in me.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.594">After that fall it was the Sintian men who took care of me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.1.595">He spoke, and the goddess of the white arms Hera smiled at him,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.596">and smiling she accepted the goblet out of her son's hand.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.597">Thereafter beginning from the left he poured drinks for the other</p>
	<p id="IL.1.598">gods, dipping up from the mixing bowl the sweet nectar.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.599">But among the blessed immortals uncontrollable laughter</p>
	<p id="IL.1.600">went up as they saw Hephaistos bustling about the palace.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.601">Thus thereafter the whole day long until the sun went under</p>
	<p id="IL.1.602">they feasted, nor was anyone's hunger denied a fair portion,</p>
	<p id="IL.1.603">nor denied the beautifully wrought lyre in the hands of Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.1.604">nor the antiphonal sweet sound of the Muses singing.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.605">Afterwards when the light of the flaming sun went under</p>
	<p id="IL.1.606">they went away each one to sleep in his home where</p>
	<p id="IL.1.607">for each one the far-renowned strong-handed Hephaistos</p>
	<p id="IL.1.608">had built a house by means of his craftsmanship and cunning.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.609">Zeus the Olympian and lord of the lightning went to</p>
	<p id="IL.1.610">his own bed, where always he lay when sweet sleep came on him.</p>
	<p id="IL.1.611">Going up to the bed he slept and Hera of the gold throne beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.1">Now the rest of the gods, and men who were lords of chariots,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.2">slept night long, but the ease of sleep came not upon Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.2.3">who was pondering in his heart how he might bring honour</p>
	<p id="IL.2.4">to Achilleus, and destroy many beside the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.5">Now to his mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.6">to send evil Dream to Atreus' son Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.7">He cried out to the dream and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.8">'Go forth, evil Dream, beside the swift ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.9">Make your way to the shelter of Atreus' son Agamemnon;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.10">speak to him in words exactly as I command you.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.11">Bid him arm the flowing-haired Achaians for battle</p>
	<p id="IL.2.12">in all haste; since now he might take the wide-wayed city</p>
	<p id="IL.2.13">of the Trojans. For no longer are the gods who live on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.14">arguing the matter, since Hera forced them all over</p>
	<p id="IL.2.15">by her supplication, and evils are in store for the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.16">So he spoke, and Dream listened to his word and descended.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.17">Lightly he came down beside the swift ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.18">and came to Agamemnon the son of Atreus. He found him</p>
	<p id="IL.2.19">sleeping within his shelter in a cloud of immortal slumber.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.20">Dream stood then beside his head in the likeness of Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.21">Neleus' son, whom Agamemnon honoured beyond all</p>
	<p id="IL.2.22">elders beside. In Nestor's likeness the divine Dream spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.23">'Son of wise Atreus breaker of horses, are you sleeping?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.24">He should not sleep night long who is a man burdened with counsels</p>
	<p id="IL.2.25">and responsibility for a people and cares so numerous.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.26">Listen quickly to what I say, since I am a messenger</p>
	<p id="IL.2.27">of Zeus, who far away cares much for you and is pitiful.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.28">Zeus bids you arm the flowing-haired Achaians for battle</p>
	<p id="IL.2.29">in all haste; since now you might take the wide-wayed city</p>
	<p id="IL.2.30">of the Trojans. For no longer are the gods who live on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.31">arguing the matter, since Hera forced them all over</p>
	<p id="IL.2.32">by her supplication, and evils are in store for the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.2.33">from Zeus. Keep this thought in your heart then, let not forgetfulness</p>
	<p id="IL.2.34">take you, after you are released from the kindly sweet slumber.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.35">So he spoke and went away, and left Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.2.36">there, believing things in his heart that were not to be accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.37">For he thought that on that very day he would take Priam's city;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.38">fool, who knew nothing of all the things Zeus planned to accomplish,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.39">Zeus, who yet was minded to visit tears and sufferings</p>
	<p id="IL.2.40">on Trojans and Danaans alike in the strong encounters.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.41">Agamemnon awoke from sleep, the divine voice drifting</p>
	<p id="IL.2.42">around him. He sat upright and put on his tunic,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.43">beautiful, fresh woven, and threw the great mantle over it.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.44">Underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals</p>
	<p id="IL.2.45">and across his shoulders slung the sword with the nails of silver,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.46">and took up the sceptre of his fathers, immortal forever.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.47">Thus he went beside the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.48">Now the goddess Dawn drew close to tall Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.49">with her message of light to Zeus and the other immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.50">But Agamemnon commanded his clear-voiced heralds to summon</p>
	<p id="IL.2.51">by proclamation to assembly the flowing-haired Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.52">and the heralds made their cry and the men were assembled swiftly.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.53">First he held a council session of the high-hearted princes</p>
	<p id="IL.2.54">beside the ship of Nestor, the king of the race of Pylos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.55">Summoning these he compacted before them his close counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.56">'Hear me, friends: in my sleep a Dream divine came to me</p>
	<p id="IL.2.57">through the immortal night, and in appearance and stature</p>
	<p id="IL.2.58">and figure it most closely resembled splendid Nestor.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.59">It came and stood above my head and spoke a word to me:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.60">"Son of wise Atreus breaker of horses, are you sleeping?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.61">He should not sleep night long who is a man burdened with counsels</p>
	<p id="IL.2.62">and responsibility for a people and cares so numerous.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.63">Now listen quickly to what I say, since I am a messenger</p>
	<p id="IL.2.64">from Zeus, who far away cares much for you and is pitiful.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.65">Zeus bids you arm the flowing-haired Achaians for battle</p>
	<p id="IL.2.66">in all haste; since now you might take the wide-wayed city</p>
	<p id="IL.2.67">of the Trojans. For no longer are the gods who live on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.68">arguing the matter, since Hera has forced them all over</p>
	<p id="IL.2.69">by her supplication, and evils are in store for the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.2.70">by Zeus' will. Keep this within your heart." So speaking</p>
	<p id="IL.2.71">the Dream went away on wings, and sweet sleep released me.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.72">Come then, let us see if we can arm the sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.73">Yet first, since it is the right way, I will make trial of them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.74">by words, and tell them even to flee in their benched vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.75">Do you take stations here and there, to check them with orders.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.76">He spoke thus, and sat down again, and among them rose up</p>
	<p id="IL.2.77">Nestor, he who ruled as a king in sandy Pylos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.78">He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.79">'Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.80">had it been any other Achaian who told of this dream</p>
	<p id="IL.2.81">we should have called it a lie and we might rather have turned from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.82">Now he who claims to be the best of the Achaians has seen it.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.83">Come then, let us see if we can arm the sons of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.84">So he spoke and led the way departing from the council,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.85">and the rest rose to their feet, the sceptred kings, obeying</p>
	<p id="IL.2.86">the shepherd of the people, and the army thronged behind them.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.87">Like the swarms of clustering bees that issue forever</p>
	<p id="IL.2.88">in fresh bursts from the hollow in the stone, and hang like</p>
	<p id="IL.2.89">bunched grapes as they hover beneath the flowers in springtime</p>
	<p id="IL.2.90">fluttering in swarms together this way and that way,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.91">so the many nations of men from the ships and the shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.2.92">along the front of the deep sea beach marched in order</p>
	<p id="IL.2.93">by companies to the assembly, and Rumour walked blazing among them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.94">Zeus' messenger, to hasten them along. Thus they were assembled</p>
	<p id="IL.2.95">and the place of their assembly was shaken, and the earth groaned</p>
	<p id="IL.2.96">as the people took their positions and there was tumult. Nine heralds</p>
	<p id="IL.2.97">shouting set about putting them in order, to make them cease their</p>
	<p id="IL.2.98">clamour and listen to the kings beloved of Zeus. The people</p>
	<p id="IL.2.99">took their seats in sober fashion and were marshalled in their places</p>
	<p id="IL.2.100">and gave over their clamouring. Powerful Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.2.101">stood up holding the sceptre Hephaistos had wrought him carefully.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.102">Hephaistos gave it to Zeus the king, the son of Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.103">and Zeus in turn gave it to the courier Argeïphontes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.104">and lord Hermes gave it to Pelops, driver of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.105">and Pelops again gave it to Atreus, the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.106">Atreus dying left it to Thyestes of the rich flocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.107">and Thyestes left it in turn to Agamemnon to carry</p>
	<p id="IL.2.108">and to be lord of many islands and over all Argos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.109">Leaning upon this sceptre he spoke and addressed the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.110">'Fighting men and friends, o Danaans, henchmen of Ares:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.111">Zeus son of Kronos has caught me fast in bitter futility.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.112">He is hard; who before this time promised me and consented</p>
	<p id="IL.2.113">that I might sack strong-walled Ilion and sail homeward.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.114">Now he has devised a vile deception, and bids me go back</p>
	<p id="IL.2.115">to Argos in dishonour having lost many of my people.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.116">Such is the way it will be pleasing to Zeus, who is too strong,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.117">who before now has broken the crests of many cities</p>
	<p id="IL.2.118">and will break them again, since his power is beyond all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.119">And this shall be a thing of shame for the men hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.2.120">to be told, that so strong, so great a host of Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.121">carried on and fought in vain a war that was useless</p>
	<p id="IL.2.122">against men fewer than they, with no accomplishment shown for it;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.123">since if both sides were to be willing, Achaians and Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.124">to cut faithful oaths of truce, and both to be numbered,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.125">and the Trojans were to be counted by those with homes in the city,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.126">while we were to be allotted in tens, we Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.127">and each one of our tens chose a man of Troy to pour wine for it,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.128">still there would be many tens left without a wine steward.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.129">By so much I claim we sons of the Achaians outnumber</p>
	<p id="IL.2.130">the Trojans--those who live in the city; but there are companions</p>
	<p id="IL.2.131">from other cities in their numbers, wielders of the spear, to help them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.132">who drive me hard back again and will not allow me,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.133">despite my will, to sack the well-founded stronghold of Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.134">And now nine years of mighty Zeus have gone by, and the timbers</p>
	<p id="IL.2.135">of our ships have rotted away and the cables are broken</p>
	<p id="IL.2.136">and far away our own wives and our young children</p>
	<p id="IL.2.137">are sitting within our halls and wait for us, while still our work here</p>
	<p id="IL.2.138">stays forever unfinished as it is, for whose sake we came hither.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.139">Come then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us</p>
	<p id="IL.2.140">run away with our ships to the beloved land of our fathers</p>
	<p id="IL.2.141">since no longer now shall we capture Troy of the wide ways.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.142">So he spoke, and stirred up the passion in the breast of all those</p>
	<p id="IL.2.143">who were within that multitude and listened to his counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.144">And the assembly was shaken as on the sea the big waves</p>
	<p id="IL.2.145">in the main by Ikaria, when the south and south-east winds</p>
	<p id="IL.2.146">driving down from the clouds of Zeus the father whip them.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.147">As when the west wind moves across the grain deep standing,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.148">boisterously, and shakes and sweeps it till the tassels lean, so</p>
	<p id="IL.2.149">all of that assembly was shaken, and the men in tumult</p>
	<p id="IL.2.150">swept to the ships, and underneath their feet the dust lifted</p>
	<p id="IL.2.151">and rose high, and the men were all shouting to one another</p>
	<p id="IL.2.152">to lay hold on the ships and drag them down to the bright sea.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.153">They cleaned out the keel channels and their cries hit skyward</p>
	<p id="IL.2.154">as they made for home and snatched the props from under the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.155">Then for the Argives a homecoming beyond fate might have</p>
	<p id="IL.2.156">been accomplished, had not Hera spoken a word to Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.157">'For shame, now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.158">As things are, the Argives will take flight homeward over</p>
	<p id="IL.2.159">the wide ridges of the sea to the land of their fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.160">and thus they would leave to Priam and to the Trojans Helen</p>
	<p id="IL.2.161">of Argos, to glory over, for whose sake many Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.162">lost their lives in Troy far from their own native country.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.163">But go now along the host of the bronze-armoured Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.164">Speak to each man in words of gentleness and draw him backward</p>
	<p id="IL.2.165">nor let them drag down to the salt sea their oarswept vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.166">So she spoke, nor did the goddess grey-eyed Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.2.167">disobey her, but went in speed down the peaks of Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.168">and lightly she arrived beside the fast ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.169">There she came on Odysseus, the equal of Zeus in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.170">standing still; he had laid no hand upon his black, strong-benched</p>
	<p id="IL.2.171">vessel, since disappointment touched his heart and his spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.172">Athene of the grey eyes stood beside him and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.173">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.174">will it be this way? Will you all hurl yourselves into your benched ships</p>
	<p id="IL.2.175">and take flight homeward to the beloved land of your fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.176">and would you thus leave to Priam and to the Trojans Helen</p>
	<p id="IL.2.177">of Argos, to glory over, for whose sake many Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.178">lost their lives in Troy far from their own native country?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.179">Go now along the host of the Achaians, give way no longer,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.180">speak to each man in words of gentleness and draw them backward,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.181">nor let them drag down to the salt sea their oarswept vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.182">So she spoke, and he knew the voice of the goddess speaking</p>
	<p id="IL.2.183">and went on the run, throwing aside his cloak, which was caught up</p>
	<p id="IL.2.184">by Eurybates the herald of Ithaka who followed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.185">He came face to face with Agamemnon, son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.186">and took from him the sceptre of his fathers, immortal forever.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.187">With this he went beside the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.188">Whenever he encountered some king, or man of influence,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.189">he would stand beside him and with soft words try to restrain him:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.190">'Excellency! It does not become you to be frightened like any</p>
	<p id="IL.2.191">coward. Rather hold fast and check the rest of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.192">You do not yet clearly understand the purpose of Atreides.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.193">Now he makes trial, but soon will bear hard on the sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.194">Did we not all hear what he was saying in council?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.195">May he not in anger do some harm to the sons of the Achaians!</p>
	<p id="IL.2.196">For the anger of god-supported kings is a big matter,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.197">to whom honour and love are given from Zeus of the counsels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.198">When he saw some man of the people who was shouting,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.199">he would strike at him with his staff, and reprove him also:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.200">'Excellency! Sit still and listen to what others tell you,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.201">to those who are better men than you, you skulker and coward</p>
	<p id="IL.2.202">and thing of no account whatever in battle or council.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.203">Surely not all of us Achaians can be as kings here.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.204">Lordship for many is no good thing. Let there be one ruler,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.205">one king, to whom the son of devious-devising Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.206">gives the sceptre and right of judgment, to watch over his people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.207">So he went through the army marshalling it, until once more</p>
	<p id="IL.2.208">they swept back into the assembly place from the ships and the shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.2.209">clamorously, as when from the thunderous sea the surf-beat</p>
	<p id="IL.2.210">crashes upon the great beach, and the whole sea is in tumult.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.211">Now the rest had sat down, and were orderly in their places,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.212">but one man, Thersites of the endless speech, still scolded,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.213">who knew within his head many words, but disorderly;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.214">vain, and without decency, to quarrel with the princes</p>
	<p id="IL.2.215">with any word he thought might be amusing to the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.216">This was the ugliest man who came beneath Ilion. He was</p>
	<p id="IL.2.217">bandy-legged and went lame of one foot, with shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.2.218">stooped and drawn together over his chest, and above this</p>
	<p id="IL.2.219">his skull went up to a point with the wool grown sparsely upon it.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.220">Beyond all others Achilleus hated him, and Odysseus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.221">These two he was forever abusing, but now at brilliant</p>
	<p id="IL.2.222">Agamemnon he clashed the shrill noise of his abuse. The Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.223">were furiously angry with him, their minds resentful.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.224">But he, crying the words aloud, scolded Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.225">'Son of Atreus, what thing further do you want, or find fault with</p>
	<p id="IL.2.226">now? Your shelters are filled with bronze, there are plenty of the choicest</p>
	<p id="IL.2.227">women for you within your shelter, whom we Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.228">give to you first of all whenever we capture some stronghold.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.229">Or is it still more gold you will be wanting, that some son</p>
	<p id="IL.2.230">of the Trojans, breakers of horses, brings as ransom out of Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.231">one that I, or some other Achaian, capture and bring in?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.232">Is it some young woman to lie with in love and keep her</p>
	<p id="IL.2.233">all to yourself apart from the others? It is not right for</p>
	<p id="IL.2.234">you, their leader, to lead in sorrow the sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.235">My good fools, poor abuses, you women, not men, of Achaia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.236">let us go back home in our ships, and leave this man here</p>
	<p id="IL.2.237">by himself in Troy to mull his prizes of honour</p>
	<p id="IL.2.238">that he may find out whether or not we others are helping him.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.239">And now he has dishonoured Achilleus, a man much better</p>
	<p id="IL.2.240">than he is. He has taken his prize by force and keeps her.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.241">But there is no gall in Achilleus' heart, and he is forgiving.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.242">Otherwise, son of Atreus, this were your last outrage.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.243">So he spoke, Thersites, abusing Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.2.244">the shepherd of the people. But brilliant Odysseus swiftly</p>
	<p id="IL.2.245">came beside him scowling and laid a harsh word upon him:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.246">'Fluent orator though you be, Thersites, your words are</p>
	<p id="IL.2.247">ill-considered. Stop, nor stand up alone against princes.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.248">Out of all those who came beneath Ilion with Atreides</p>
	<p id="IL.2.249">I assert there is no worse man than you are. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.2.250">you shall not lift up your mouth to argue with princes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.251">cast reproaches into their teeth, nor sustain the homegoing.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.252">We do not even know clearly how these things will be accomplished,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.253">whether we sons of the Achaians shall win home well or badly;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.254">yet you sit here throwing abuse at Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.255">Atreus' son, the shepherd of the people, because the Danaan</p>
	<p id="IL.2.256">fighters give him much. You argue nothing but scandal.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.257">And this also will I tell you, and it will be a thing accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.258">If once more I find you playing the fool, as you are now,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.259">nevermore let the head of Odysseus sit on his shoulders,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.260">let me nevermore be called Telemachos' father,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.261">if I do not take you and strip away your personal clothing,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.262">your mantle and your tunic that cover over your nakedness,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.263">and send you thus bare and howling back to the fast ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.264">whipping you out of the assembly place with the strokes of indignity.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.265">So he spoke and dashed the sceptre against his back and</p>
	<p id="IL.2.266">shoulders, and he doubled over, and a round tear dropped from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.267">and a bloody welt stood up between his shoulders under</p>
	<p id="IL.2.268">the golden sceptre's stroke, and he sat down again, frightened,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.269">in pain, and looking helplessly about wiped off the tear-drops.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.270">Sorry though the men were they laughed over him happily,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.271">and thus they would speak to each other, each looking at the man next him:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.272">'Come now: Odysseus has done excellent things by thousands,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.273">bringing forward good counsels and ordering armed encounters;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.274">but now this is far the best thing he ever has accomplished</p>
	<p id="IL.2.275">among the Argives, to keep this thrower of words, this braggart</p>
	<p id="IL.2.276">out of assembly. Never again will his proud heart stir him</p>
	<p id="IL.2.277">up, to wrangle with the princes in words of revilement.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.278">So the multitude spoke, but Odysseus, sacker of cities,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.279">stood up holding the staff, and beside him grey-eyed Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.2.280">in the likeness of a herald enjoined the people to silence,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.281">that at once the foremost and the utmost sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.282">might listen to him speaking and deliberate his counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.283">He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.284">'Son of Atreus: now, my lord, the Achaians are trying</p>
	<p id="IL.2.285">to make you into a thing of reproach in the sight of all mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.2.286">men, and not fulfilling the promise they undertook once</p>
	<p id="IL.2.287">as they set forth to come here from horse-pasturing Argos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.288">to go home only after you had sacked strong-walled Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.289">For as if they were young children or widowed women</p>
	<p id="IL.2.290">they cry out and complain to each other about going homeward.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.291">In truth, it is a hard thing, to be grieved with desire for going.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.292">Any man who stays away one month from his own wife</p>
	<p id="IL.2.293">with his intricate ship is impatient, one whom the storm winds</p>
	<p id="IL.2.294">of winter and the sea rising keep back. And for us now</p>
	<p id="IL.2.295">this is the ninth of the circling years that we wait here. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.2.296">I cannot find fault with the Achaians for their impatience</p>
	<p id="IL.2.297">beside the curved ships; yet always it is disgraceful</p>
	<p id="IL.2.298">to wait long and at the end go home empty-handed.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.299">No, but be patient, friends, and stay yet a little longer</p>
	<p id="IL.2.300">until we know whether Kalchas' prophecy is true or is not true.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.301">For I remember this thing well in my heart, and you all are</p>
	<p id="IL.2.302">witnesses, whom the spirits of death have not carried away from us;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.303">yesterday and before, at Aulis, when the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.304">were gathered bringing disaster to the Trojans and Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.305">and we beside a spring and upon the sacred altars</p>
	<p id="IL.2.306">were accomplishing complete hecatombs to the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.2.307">under a fair plane tree whence ran the shining of water.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.308">There appeared a great sign; a snake, his back blood-mottled,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.309">a thing of horror, cast into the light by the very Olympian,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.310">wound its way from under the altar and made toward the plane tree.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.311">Thereupon were innocent children, the young of the sparrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.312">cowering underneath the leaves at the uttermost branch tip,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.313">eight of them, and the mother was the ninth, who bore these children.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.314">The snake ate them all after their pitiful screaming,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.315">and the mother, crying aloud for her young ones, fluttered about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.316">and as she shrilled he caught her by the wing and coiled around her.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.317">After he had eaten the sparrow herself with her children</p>
	<p id="IL.2.318">the god who had shown the snake forth made him a monument,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.319">striking him stone, the son of devious-devising Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.320">and we standing about marvelled at the thing that had been done.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.321">So as the terror and the god's monsters came into the hecatomb</p>
	<p id="IL.2.322">Kalchas straightway spoke before us interpreting the gods' will:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.323">"Why are you turned voiceless, you flowing-haired Achaians?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.324">Zeus of the counsels has shown us this great portent: a thing late,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.325">late to be accomplished, whose glory shall perish never.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.326">As this snake has eaten the sparrow herself with her children,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.327">eight of them, and the mother was the ninth, who bore them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.328">so for years as many as this shall we fight in this place</p>
	<p id="IL.2.329">and in the tenth year we shall take the city of the wide ways."</p>
	<p id="IL.2.330">So he spoke to us then; now all this is being accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.331">Come then, you strong-greaved Achaians, let every man stay</p>
	<p id="IL.2.332">here, until we have taken the great citadel of Priam.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.333">So he spoke, and the Argives shouted aloud, and about them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.334">the ships echoed terribly to the roaring Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.335">as they cried out applause to the word of godlike Odysseus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.336">Now among them spoke the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.337">'Oh, for shame! You are like children when you hold assembly,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.338">infant children, to whom the works of war mean nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.339">Where then shall our covenants go, and the oaths we have taken?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.340">Let counsels and the meditations of men be given to the flames then,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.341">with the unmixed wine poured and the right hands we trusted.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.342">We do our fighting with words only, and can discover</p>
	<p id="IL.2.343">no remedy, though we have stayed here a long time. Son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.344">do you still as before hold fast to your counsel unshaken</p>
	<p id="IL.2.345">and be the leader of the Argives through the strong encounters;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.346">let them go perish, these one or two, who think apart from</p>
	<p id="IL.2.347">the rest of the Achaians, since there will be no use in them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.348">until they get back again to Argos without ever learning</p>
	<p id="IL.2.349">whether Zeus of the aegis promises false or truly.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.350">For I say to you, the son of all-powerful Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.351">promised, on that day when we went in our fast-running vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.352">we of Argos, carrying blood and death to the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.353">He flashed lightning on our right, showing signs of favour.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.354">Therefore let no man be urgent to take the way homeward</p>
	<p id="IL.2.355">until after he has lain in bed with the wife of a Trojan</p>
	<p id="IL.2.356">to avenge Helen's longing to escape and her lamentations.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.357">But if any man is terribly desirous to go home,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.358">let him only lay his hands on his well-benched black ship,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.359">that before all others he may win death and destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.360">Come, my lord: yourself be careful, and listen to another.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.361">This shall not be a word to be cast away that I tell you.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.362">Set your men in order by tribes, by clans, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.363">and let clan go in support of clan, let tribe support tribe.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.364">If you do it this way, and the Achaians obey you,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.365">you will see which of your leaders is bad, and which of your people,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.366">and which also is brave, since they will fight in divisions,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.367">and might learn also whether by magic you fail to take this</p>
	<p id="IL.2.368">city, or by men's cowardice and ignorance of warfare.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.369">Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.370">'Once again, old sir, you surpass the sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.371">in debate. O father Zeus, Athene, Apollo:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.372">would that among the Achaians I had ten such counsellors.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.373">Then perhaps the city of lord Priam would be bent</p>
	<p id="IL.2.374">underneath our hands, captured and sacked. But instead</p>
	<p id="IL.2.375">Zeus of the aegis, son of Kronos, has given me bitterness,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.376">who drives me into unprofitable abuse and quarrels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.377">For I and Achilleus fought together for a girl's sake</p>
	<p id="IL.2.378">in words' violent encounter, and I was the first to be angry.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.379">If ever we can take one single counsel, then no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.2.380">shall the Trojans' evil be put aside, not even for a small time.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.381">Now go back, take your dinner, and let us gather our warcraft.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.382">Let a man put a good edge to his spear, and his shield in order,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.383">let each put good fodder before his swift-footed horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.384">and each man look well over his chariot, careful of his fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.385">that all day long we may be in the division of hateful Ares.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.386">There will not even for a small time be any respite</p>
	<p id="IL.2.387">unless darkness come down to separate the strength of the fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.388">There will be a man's sweat on the shield-strap binding the breast to</p>
	<p id="IL.2.389">the shield hiding the man's shape, and the hand on the spear grow weary.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.390">There will be sweat on a man's horse straining at the smoothed chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.391">But any man whom I find trying, apart from the battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.392">to hang back by the curved ships, for him no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.2.393">will there be any means to escape the dogs and the vultures.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.394">So he spoke, and the Argives shouted aloud, as surf crashing</p>
	<p id="IL.2.395">against a sheerness, driven by the south wind descending,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.396">some cliff out-jutting, left never alone by the waves from</p>
	<p id="IL.2.397">all the winds that blow, as they rise one place and another.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.398">They stood up scattering and made for the ships; they kindled</p>
	<p id="IL.2.399">the fires' smoke along the shelters, and took their dinner,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.400">each man making a sacrifice to some one of the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.2.401">gods, in prayer to escape death and the grind of Ares.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.402">But Agamemnon the lord of men dedicated a fat ox</p>
	<p id="IL.2.403">five years old to Zeus, all-powerful son of Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.404">and summoned the nobles and the great men of all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.405">Nestor before all others, and next the lord Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.406">next the two Aiantes and Tydeus' son Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.407">and sixth Odysseus, a man like Zeus himself for counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.408">Of his own accord came Menelaos of the great war cry</p>
	<p id="IL.2.409">who knew well in his own mind the cares of his brother.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.410">They stood in a circle about the ox and took up the scattering</p>
	<p id="IL.2.411">barley; and among them powerful Agamemnon spoke in prayer:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.412">'Zeus, exalted and mightiest, sky-dwelling in the dark mist:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.413">let not the sun go down and disappear into darkness</p>
	<p id="IL.2.414">until I have hurled headlong the castle of Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.2.415">blazing, and lit the castle gates with the flames' destruction;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.416">not till I have broken at the chest the tunic of Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.2.417">torn with the bronze blade, and let many companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.2.418">go down headlong into the dust, teeth gripping the ground soil.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.419">He spoke, but none of this would the son of Kronos accomplish,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.420">who accepted the victims, but piled up the unwished-for hardship.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.421">Now when all had made prayer and flung down the scattering barley,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.422">first they drew back the victim's head, cut his throat and skinned him,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.423">and cut away the meat from the thighs and wrapped them in fat,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.424">making a double fold, and laid shreds of flesh above them.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.425">Placing these on sticks cleft and peeled they burned them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.426">and spitted the vitals and held them over the flame of Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.427">But when they had burned the thigh pieces and tasted the vitals</p>
	<p id="IL.2.428">they cut all the remainder into pieces and spitted them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.429">and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.430">Then after they had finished the work and got the feast ready</p>
	<p id="IL.2.431">they feasted, nor was any man's hunger denied a fair portion.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.432">But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking</p>
	<p id="IL.2.433">the Gerenian horseman Nestor began speaking among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.434">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.435">let us talk no more of these things, nor for a long time</p>
	<p id="IL.2.436">set aside the action which the god puts into our hands now.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.437">Come then, let the heralds of the bronze-armoured Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.438">make proclamation to the people and assemble them by the vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.439">and let us together as we are go down the wide host</p>
	<p id="IL.2.440">of the Achaians, to stir more quickly the fierce war god.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.441">He spoke, nor did the lord of men Agamemnon neglect him,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.442">but straightway commanded the clear-voiced heralds to summon</p>
	<p id="IL.2.443">by proclamation to battle the flowing-haired Achaians;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.444">and the heralds made their cry and the men were assembled swiftly.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.445">And they, the god-supported kings, about Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.2.446">ran marshalling the men, and among them grey-eyed Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.2.447">holding the dear treasured aegis, ageless, immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.448">from whose edges float a hundred all-golden tassels,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.449">each one carefully woven, and each worth a hundred oxen.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.450">With this fluttering she swept through the host of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.451">urging them to go forward. She kindled the strength in each man's</p>
	<p id="IL.2.452">heart to take the battle without respite and keep on fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.453">And now battle became sweeter to them than to go back</p>
	<p id="IL.2.454">in their hollow ships to the beloved land of their fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.455">As obliterating fire lights up a vast forest</p>
	<p id="IL.2.456">along the crests of a mountain, and the flare shows far off,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.457">so as they marched, from the magnificent bronze the gleam went</p>
	<p id="IL.2.458">dazzling all about through the upper air to the heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.459">These, as the multitudinous nations of birds winged,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.460">of geese, and of cranes, and of swans long-throated</p>
	<p id="IL.2.461">in the Asian meadow beside the Kaïstrian waters</p>
	<p id="IL.2.462">this way and that way make their flights in the pride of their wings, then</p>
	<p id="IL.2.463">settle in clashing swarms and the whole meadow echoes with them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.464">so of these the multitudinous tribes from the ships and</p>
	<p id="IL.2.465">shelters poured to the plain of Skamandros, and the earth beneath their</p>
	<p id="IL.2.466">feet and under the feet of their horses thundered horribly.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.467">They took position in the blossoming meadow of Skamandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.468">thousands of them, as leaves and flowers appear in their season.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.469">Like the multitudinous nations of swarming insects</p>
	<p id="IL.2.470">who drive hither and thither about the stalls of the sheepfold</p>
	<p id="IL.2.471">in the season of spring when the milk splashes in the milk pails:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.472">in such numbers the flowing-haired Achaians stood up</p>
	<p id="IL.2.473">through the plain against the Trojans, hearts burning to break them.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.474">These, as men who are goatherds among the wide goatflocks</p>
	<p id="IL.2.475">easily separate them in order as they take to the pasture,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.476">thus the leaders separated them this way and that way</p>
	<p id="IL.2.477">toward the encounter, and among them powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.478">with eyes and head like Zeus who delights in thunder,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.479">like Ares for girth, and with the chest of Poseidon;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.480">like some ox of the herd pre-eminent among the others,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.481">a bull, who stands conspicuous in the huddling cattle;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.482">such was the son of Atreus as Zeus made him that day,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.483">conspicuous among men, and foremost among the fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.484">Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.485">For you, who are goddesses, are there, and you know all things,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.486">and we have heard only the rumour of it and know nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.487">Who then of those were the chief men and the lords of the Danaans?</p>
	<p id="IL.2.488">I could not tell over the multitude of them nor name them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.489">not if I had ten tongues and ten mouths, not if I had</p>
	<p id="IL.2.490">a voice never to be broken and a heart of bronze within me,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.491">not unless the Muses of Olympia, daughters</p>
	<p id="IL.2.492">of Zeus of the aegis, remembered all those who came beneath Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.493">I will tell the lords of the ships, and the ships numbers.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.494">Leïtos and Peneleos were leaders of the Boiotians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.495">with Arkesilaos and Prothoenor and Klonios;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.496">they who lived in Hyria and in rocky Aulis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.497">in the hill-bends of Eteonos, and Schoinos, and Skolos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.498">Thespeia and Graia, and in spacious Mykalessos;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.499">they who dwelt about Harma and Eilesion and Erythrai,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.500">they who held Eleon and Hyle and Peteon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.501">with Okalea and Medeon, the strong-founded citadel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.502">Kopai, and Eutresis, and Thisbe of the dove-cotes;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.503">they who held Koroneia, and the meadows of Haliartos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.504">they who held Plataia, and they who dwelt about Glisa,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.505">they who held the lower Thebes, the strong-founded citadel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.506">and Onchestos the sacred, the shining grove of Poseidon;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.507">they who held Arne of the great vineyards, and Mideia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.508">with Nisa the sacrosanct and uttermost Anthedon.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.509">Of these there were fifty ships in all, and on board</p>
	<p id="IL.2.510">each of these a hundred and twenty sons of the Boiotians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.511">But they who lived in Aspledon and Orchomenos of the Minyai,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.512">Askalaphos led these, and Ialmenos, children of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.513">whom Astyoche bore to him in the house of Aktor</p>
	<p id="IL.2.514">Azeus' son, a modest maiden; she went into the chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.2.515">with strong Ares, who was laid in bed with her secretly.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.516">With these two there were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.517">Schedios and Epistrophos led the men of Phokis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.518">children of Iphitos, who was son of great-hearted Naubolos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.519">These held Kyparissos, and rocky Pytho, and Krisa</p>
	<p id="IL.2.520">the sacrosanct together with Daulis and Panopeus;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.521">they who lived about Hyampolis and Anamoreia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.522">they who dwelt about Kephisos, the river immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.523">they who held Lilaia beside the well springs of Kephisos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.524">Following along with these were forty black ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.525">and the leaders marshalling the ranks of the Phokians set them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.526">in arms on the left wing of the host beside the Boiotians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.527">Swift Aias son of Oïleus led the men of Lokris,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.528">the lesser Aias, not great in size like the son of Telamon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.529">but far slighter. He was a small man armoured in linen,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.530">yet with the throwing spear surpassed all Achaians and Hellenes.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.531">These were the dwellers in Kynos and Opoeis and Kalliaros,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.532">and in Bessa, and Skarphe, and lovely Augeiai,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.533">in Thronion and Tarphe and beside the waters of Boagrios.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.534">Following along with him were forty black ships</p>
	<p id="IL.2.535">of the Lokrians, who dwell across from sacred Euboia.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.536">They who held Euboia, the Abantes, whose wind was fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.537">Chalkis, and Eretria, the great vineyards of Histiaia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.538">and seaborne Kerinthos and the steep stronghold of Dion,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.539">they who held Karystos and they who dwelt about Styra,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.540">of these the leader was Elephenor, scion of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.541">son of Chalkodon and lord of the great-hearted Abantes.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.542">And the running Abantes followed with him, their hair grown</p>
	<p id="IL.2.543">long at the back, spearmen furious with the out-reached ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.2.544">to rip the corselets girt about the chests of their enemies.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.545">Following along with him were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.546">But the men who held Athens, the strong-founded citadel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.547">the deme of great-hearted Erechtheus, whom once Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.2.548">Zeus' daughter tended after the grain-giving fields had born him,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.549">and established him to be in Athens in her own rich temple;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.550">there as the circling years go by the sons of the Athenians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.551">make propitiation with rams and bulls sacrificed;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.552">of these men the leader was Peteos' son Menestheus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.553">Never on earth before had there been a man born like him</p>
	<p id="IL.2.554">for the arrangement in order of horses and shielded fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.555">Nestor alone could challenge him, since he was far older.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.556">Following along with him were fifty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.557">Out of Salamis Aias brought twelve ships and placed them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.558">next to where the Athenian battalions were drawn up.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.559">They who held Argos and Tiryns of the huge walls,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.560">Hermione and Asine lying down the deep gulf,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.561">Troizen and Eïonai, and Epidauros of the vineyards,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.562">they who held Aigina and Mases, sons of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.563">of these the leader was Diomedes of the great war cry</p>
	<p id="IL.2.564">with Sthenelos, own son to the high-renowned Kapaneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.565">and with them as a third went Euryalos, a man godlike,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.566">son of Mekisteus the king, and scion of Talaos;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.567">but the leader of all was Diomedes of the great war cry.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.568">Following along with these were eighty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.569">But the men who held Mykenai, the strong-founded citadel,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.570">Korinth the luxurious, and strong-founded Kleonai;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.571">they who dwelt in Orneai and lovely Araithyrea,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.572">and Sikyon, where of old Adrestos had held the kingship;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.573">they who held Hyperesia and steep Gonoëssa,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.574">they who held Pellene and they who dwelt about Aigion,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.575">all about the sea-shore and about the wide headland of Helike,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.576">of their hundred ships the leader was powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.577">Atreus' son, with whom followed far the best and bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.2.578">people; and among them he himself stood armoured in shining</p>
	<p id="IL.2.579">bronze, glorying, conspicuous among the great fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.580">since he was greatest among them all, and led the most people.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.581">They who held the swarming hollow of Lakedaimon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.582">Pharis, and Sparta, and Messe of the dove-cotes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.583">they who dwelt in Bryseiai and lovely Augeiai,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.584">they who held Amyklai and the seaward city of Helos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.585">they who held Laas, and they who dwelt about Oitylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.586">of these his brother Menelaos of the great war cry</p>
	<p id="IL.2.587">was leader, with sixty ships marshalled apart from the others.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.588">He himself went among them in the confidence of his valour,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.589">driving them battleward, since above all his heart was eager</p>
	<p id="IL.2.590">to avenge Helen's longing to escape and her lamentations.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.591">They who dwelt about Pylos and lovely Arene,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.592">and Thryon, the Alpheios crossing, and strong-built Aipy;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.593">they who lived in Kyparisseeis and Amphigeneia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.594">Pteleos and Helos and Dorion, where the Muses</p>
	<p id="IL.2.595">encountering Thamyris the Thracian stopped him from singing</p>
	<p id="IL.2.596">as he came from Oichalia and Oichalian Eurytos;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.597">for he boasted that he would surpass, if the very Muses,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.598">daughters of Zeus who holds the aegis, were singing against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.599">and these in their anger struck him maimed, and the voice of wonder</p>
	<p id="IL.2.600">they took away, and made him a singer without memory;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.601">of these the leader was the Gerenian horseman, Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.602">in whose command were marshalled ninety hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.603">They who held Arkadia under the sheer peak, Kyllene,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.604">beside the tomb of Aipytos, where men fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.605">they who dwelt in Orchomenos of the flocks, and Pheneos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.606">about Rhipe and Stratia and windy Enispe;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.607">they who held Tegea and Mantineia the lovely,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.608">they who held Stymphalos, and dwelt about Parrhasia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.609">their leader was Angkaios' son, powerful Agapenor.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.610">Sixty was the number of their ships, and in each ship</p>
	<p id="IL.2.611">went many men of Arkadia, well skilled in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.612">Agamemnon the lord of men himself had given</p>
	<p id="IL.2.613">these for the crossing of the wine-blue sea their strong-benched vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.614">Atreus' son, since the work of the sea was nothing to these men.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.615">They who lived in Bouprasion and brilliant Elis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.616">all as much as Hyrmine and Myrsinos the uttermost</p>
	<p id="IL.2.617">and the Olenian rock and Alesion close between them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.618">of these there were four chieftains, and with each man ten swift</p>
	<p id="IL.2.619">vessels followed, with many Epeian men on board them.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.620">Of two tens Thalpios and Amphimachos were leaders,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.621">of Aktor's seed, sons one of Kteatos, one of Eurytos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.622">Ten more were led by Amaryngkeus' son, strong Diores,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.623">and of the fourth ten godlike Polyxeinos was leader,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.624">son of lord Agasthenes, of the race of Augeias.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.625">They who came from Doulichion and the sacred Echinai,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.626">islands, where men live across the water from Elis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.627">Meges was the leader of these, a man like Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.628">Phyleus' son, whom the rider dear to Zeus had begotten,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.629">Phyleus, who angered with his father had settled Doulichion.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.630">Following along with him were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.631">But Odysseus led the high-hearted men of Kephallenia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.632">those who held Ithaka and leaf-trembling Neriton,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.633">those who dwelt about Krokyleia and rigged Aigilips,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.634">those who held Zakynthos and those who dwelt about Samos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.635">those who held the mainland and the places next to the crossing.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.636">All these men were led by Odysseus, like Zeus in counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.637">Following with him were twelve ships with bows red painted.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.638">Thoas son of Andraimon was leader of the Aitolians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.639">those who dwelt in Pleuron and Olenos and Pylene,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.640">Kalydon of the rocks and Chalkis beside the sea-shore,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.641">since no longer were the sons of high-hearted Oineus living,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.642">nor Oineus himself, and fair-haired Meleagros had perished.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.643">So all the lordship of the Aitolians was given to Thoas.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.644">Following along with him were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.645">Idomeneus the spear-famed was leader of the Kretans,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.646">those who held Knosos and Gortyna of the great walls,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.647">Lyktos and Miletos and silver-shining Lykastos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.648">and Phaistos and Rhytion, all towns well established,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.649">and others who dwelt beside them in Krete of the hundred cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.650">Of all these Idomeneus the spear-famed was leader,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.651">with Meriones, a match for the murderous Lord of Battles.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.652">Following along with these were eighty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.653">Herakles' son Tlepolemos the huge and mighty</p>
	<p id="IL.2.654">led from Rhodes nine ships with the proud men of Rhodes aboard them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.655">those who dwelt about Rhodes and were ordered in triple division,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.656">Ialysos and Lindos and silver-shining Kameiros.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.657">Of all these Tlepolemos the spear-famed was leader,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.658">he whom Astyocheia bore to the strength of Herakles.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.659">Herakles brought her from Ephyra and the river Selleëis</p>
	<p id="IL.2.660">after he sacked many cities of strong, god-supported fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.661">Now when Tlepolemos was grown in the strong-built mansion,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.662">he struck to death his own father's beloved uncle,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.663">Likymnios, scion of Ares, a man already ageing.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.664">At once he put ships together and assembled a host of people</p>
	<p id="IL.2.665">and went fugitive over the sea, since the others threatened,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.666">the rest of the sons and the grandsons of the strength of Herakles.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.667">And he came to Rhodes a wanderer, a man of misfortune,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.668">and they settled there in triple division by tribes, beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.2.669">of Zeus himself, who is lord over all gods and all men,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.670">Kronos' son, who showered the wonder of wealth upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.671">Nireus from Syme led three balanced vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.672">Nireus son of Aglaia and the king Charopos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.673">Nireus, the most beautiful man who came beneath Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.2.674">beyond the rest of the Danaans next after perfect Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.675">But he was a man of poor strength and few people with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.676">They who held Nisyros and Krapathos and Kasos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.677">and Kos, Eurypylos' city, and the islands called Kalydnai,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.678">of these again Pheidippos and Antiphos were the leaders,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.679">sons both of Thessalos who was born to the lord Herakles.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.680">In their command were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.681">Now all those who dwelt about Pelasgian Argos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.682">those who lived by Alos and Alope and at Trachis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.683">those who held Phthia and Hellas the land of fair women,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.684">who were called Myrmidons and Hellenes and Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.685">of all these and their fifty ships the lord was Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.686">But these took no thought now for the grim clamour of battle</p>
	<p id="IL.2.687">since there was no one who could guide them into close order,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.688">since he, swift-footed brilliant Achilleus, lay where the ships were,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.689">angered over the girl of the lovely hair, Briseis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.690">whom after much hard work he had taken away from Lyrnessos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.691">after he had sacked Lyrnessos and the walls of Thebe</p>
	<p id="IL.2.692">and struck down Epistrophos and Mynes the furious spearmen,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.693">children of Euenos, king, and son of Selepios.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.694">For her sake he lay grieving now, but was soon to rise up.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.695">They who held Phylake and Pyrasos of the flowers,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.696">the precinct of Demeter, and Iton, mother of sheepflocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.697">Antron by the sea-shore, and Pteleos deep in the meadows,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.698">of these in turn fighting Protesilaos was leader</p>
	<p id="IL.2.699">while he lived; but now the black earth had closed him under,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.700">whose wife, cheeks torn for grief, was left behind in Phylake</p>
	<p id="IL.2.701">and a marriage half completed; a Dardanian man had killed him</p>
	<p id="IL.2.702">as he leapt from his ship, far the first of all the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.703">Yet these, longing as they did for their leader, did not go leaderless,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.704">but Podarkes, scion of Ares, set them in order,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.705">child of Iphikles, who in turn was son to Phylakos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.706">rich in flocks, full brother of high-hearted Protesilaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.707">younger born; but the elder man was braver also,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.708">Protesilaos, a man of battle; yet still the people</p>
	<p id="IL.2.709">lacked not a leader, though they longed for him and his valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.710">Following along with Podarkes were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.711">They who lived by Pherai beside the lake Boibeis,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.712">by Boibe and Glaphyrai and strong-founded Iolkos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.713">of their eleven ships the dear son of Admetos was leader,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.714">Eumelos, born to Admetos by the beauty among women</p>
	<p id="IL.2.715">Alkestis, loveliest of all the daughters of Pelias.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.716">They who lived about Thaumakia and Methone,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.717">they who held Meliboia and rugged Olizon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.718">of their seven ships the leader was Philoktetes</p>
	<p id="IL.2.719">skilled in the bow's work, and aboard each vessel were fifty</p>
	<p id="IL.2.720">oarsmen, each well skilled in the strength of the bow in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.721">Yet he himself lay apart in the island, suffering strong pains,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.722">in Lemnos the sacrosanct, where the sons of the Achaians had left him</p>
	<p id="IL.2.723">in agony from the sore bite of the wicked water snake.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.724">There he lay apart in his pain; yet soon the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.2.725">beside their ships were to remember lord Philoktetes.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.726">Yet these, longing as they did for their leader, did not go leaderless,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.727">but Medon, the bastard son of Oileus, set them in order,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.728">whom Rhene bore to Oïleus the sacker of cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.729">They who held Trikke and the terraced place of Ithome,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.730">and Oichalia, the city of Oichalian Eurytos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.731">of these in turn the leaders were two sons of Asklepios,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.732">good healers both themselves, Podaleirios and Machaon.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.733">In their command were marshalled thirty hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.734">They who held Ormenios and the spring Hypereia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.735">they who held Asterion and the pale peaks of Titanos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.736">Eurypylos led these, the shining son of Euaimon.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.737">Following along with him were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.738">They who held Argissa and dwelt about Gyrtone,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.739">Orthe and Elone and the white city Oloösson,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.740">of these the leader was Polypoites, stubborn in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.741">son of Peirithoös whose father was Zeus immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.742">he whom glorious Hippodameia bore to Peirithoös</p>
	<p id="IL.2.743">on that day when he wreaked vengeance on the hairy beast men</p>
	<p id="IL.2.744">and drove them from Pelion and hurled them against the Aithikes;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.745">not by himself, for Leonteus was with him, scion of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.746">Leonteus, son of high-hearted Koronos the son of Kaineus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.747">Following in the guidance of these were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.748">Gouneus from Kyphos led two and twenty vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.749">and the Enienes and the Perrhaibians stubborn in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.2.750">followed him, they who made their homes by wintry Dodona,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.751">and they who by lovely Titaressos held the tilled acres,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.752">Titaressos, who into Peneios casts his bright current:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.753">yet he is not mixed with the silver whirls of Peneios,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.754">but like oil is floated along the surface above him:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.755">since he is broken from the water of Styx, the fearful oath-river.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.756">Prothoös son of Tenthredon was leader of the Magnesians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.757">those who dwelt about Peneios and leaf-trembling</p>
	<p id="IL.2.758">Pelion. Of these Prothoös the swift-footed was leader.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.759">Following along with him were forty black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.760">These then were the leaders and the princes among the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.761">Tell me then, Muse, who of them all was the best and bravest,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.762">of the men, and the men's horses, who went with the sons of Atreus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.763">Best by far among the horses were the mares of Eumelos</p>
	<p id="IL.2.764">Pheres' son, that he drove, swift-moving like birds, alike in</p>
	<p id="IL.2.765">texture of coat, in age, both backs drawn level like a plumb-line.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.766">These Apollo of the silver bow had bred in Pereia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.767">mares alike, who went with the terror of the god of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.768">Among the men far the best was Telamonian Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.2.769">while Achilleus stayed angry, since he was far best of all of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.770">and the horses also, who carried the blameless son of Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.771">But Achilleus lay apart among his curved sea-wandering</p>
	<p id="IL.2.772">vessels, raging at Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.773">Atreus' son; and his men beside the break of the sea-beach</p>
	<p id="IL.2.774">amused themselves with discs and with light spears for throwing</p>
	<p id="IL.2.775">and bows; and the horses, standing each beside his chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.776">champed their clover and the parsley that grows in wet places,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.777">resting, while the chariots of their lords stood covered</p>
	<p id="IL.2.778">in the shelters, and the men forlorn of their warlike leader</p>
	<p id="IL.2.779">wandered here and there in the camp, and did no fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.780">But the rest went forward, as if all the earth with flame were eaten,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.781">and the ground echoed under them, as if Zeus who delights in thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.2.782">were angry, as when he batters the earth about Typhoeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.783">in the land of the Arimoi, where they say Typhoeus lies prostrate.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.784">Thus beneath their feet the ground re-echoed loudly</p>
	<p id="IL.2.785">to men marching, who made their way through the plain in great speed.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.786">Now to the Trojans came as messenger wind-footed Iris,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.787">in her speed, with the dark message from Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.788">These were holding assembly in front of the doors of Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.2.789">gathered together in one place, the elders and the young men.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.790">Standing close at hand swift-running Iris spoke to them,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.791">and likened her voice to that of the son of Priam, Polites,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.792">who confident in the speed of his feet kept watch for the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.2.793">aloft the ancient burial mound of ancient Aisyetes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.794">waiting for the time when the Achaians should move from their vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.795">In this man's likeness Iris the swift-running spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.796">'Old sir, dear to you forever are words beyond number</p>
	<p id="IL.2.797">as once, when there was peace; but stintless war has arisen.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.798">In my time I have gone into many battles among men,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.799">yet never have I seen a host like this, not one so numerous.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.800">These look terribly like leaves, or the sands of the sea-shore,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.801">as they advance across the plain to fight by the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.802">Hektor, on you beyond all I urge this, to do as I tell you:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.803">all about the great city of Priam are many companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.804">but multitudinous is the speech of the scattered nations:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.805">let each man who is their leader give orders to these men,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.806">and let each set his citizens in order, and lead them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.2.807">She spoke, nor did Hektor fail to mark the word of the goddess.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.808">Instantly he broke up the assembly; they ran to their weapons.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.809">All the gates were opened and the people swept through them</p>
	<p id="IL.2.810">on foot, and with horses, and a clamour of shouting rose up.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.811">Near the city but apart from it there is a steep hill</p>
	<p id="IL.2.812">in the plain by itself, so you pass one side or the other.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.813">This men call the Hill of the Thicket, but the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.2.814">gods have named it the burial mound of dancing Myrina.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.815">There the Trojans and their companions were marshalled in order.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.816">Tall Hektor of the shining helm was leader of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.817">Priam's son; and with him far the best and the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.2.818">fighting men were armed and eager to fight with the spear's edge.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.819">The strong son of Anchises was leader of the Dardanians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.820">Aineias, whom divine Aphrodite bore to Anchises</p>
	<p id="IL.2.821">in the folds of Ida, a goddess lying in love with a mortal:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.822">not Aineias alone, but with him were two sons of Antenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.823">Archelochos and Akamas, both skilled in all fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.824">They who lived in Zeleia below the foot of Mount Ida,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.825">men of wealth, who drank the dark water of Aisepos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.826">Trojans: of these the leader was the shining son of Lykaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.827">Pandaros, with the bow that was actual gift of Apollo.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.828">They who held Adresteia and the countryside of Apaisos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.829">they who held Pityeia and the sheer hill of Tereia,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.830">these were led by Adrestos and Amphios armoured in linen,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.831">sons both of Merops of Perkote, who beyond all men</p>
	<p id="IL.2.832">knew the art of prophecy, and tried to prevent his two sons</p>
	<p id="IL.2.833">from going into the battle where men die. Yet these would not</p>
	<p id="IL.2.834">listen, for the spirits of dark death were driving them onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.835">They who dwelt in the places about Perkote and Praktion,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.836">who held Sestos and Abydos and brilliant Arisbe,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.837">their leader was Asios, Hyrtakos' son, a prince of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.838">Asios, son of Hyrtakos, whom huge and shining</p>
	<p id="IL.2.839">horses carried from Arisbe and the river Selleëis.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.840">Hippothoös led the tribes of spear-fighting Pelasgians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.841">they who dwelt where the soil is rich about Larissa;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.842">Hippothoös and Pylaios, scion of Ares, led these,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.843">sons alike of Pelasgian Lethos, son of Teutamos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.844">Akamas led the men of Thrace with the fighter Peiroös,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.845">all the Thracians held within the hard stream of the Hellespont.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.846">Euphemos was leader of the Kikonian spearmen,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.847">son of Troizenos, Keas' son, the king whom the gods loved.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.848">Pyraichmes in turn led the Paionians with their curved bows,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.849">from Amydon far away and the broad stream of Axios,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.850">Axios, whose stream on all earth is the loveliest water.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.851">Pylaimenes the wild heart was leader of the Paphlagones,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.852">from the land of the Enetoi where the wild mules are engendered,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.853">those who held Kytoros and those who dwelt about Sesamos,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.854">those whose renowned homes were about Parthenios river,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.855">and Kromna and Aigialos and high Erythinoi.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.856">Odios and Epistrophos led the Halizones</p>
	<p id="IL.2.857">from Alybe far away, where silver was first begotten.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.858">Chromis, with Ennomos the augur, was lord of the Mysians;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.859">yet his reading of birds could not keep off dark destruction</p>
	<p id="IL.2.860">but he went down under the hands of swift-running Aiakides</p>
	<p id="IL.2.861">in the river, as he slew other Trojans beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.862">Phorkys and godlike Askanios were lords of the Phrygians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.863">from Askania far away, eager to fight in the onfall.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.864">Mesthles and Antiphos were leaders of the Maionians,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.865">sons of Talaimenes, who was born of the lake Gygaian:</p>
	<p id="IL.2.866">these led the Maionian men whose home was beneath Mount Tmolos.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.867">The Karians of the outland speech were led by Nastes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.868">they who held Miletos and the leaf-deep mountain of Phthiron,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.869">the waters of Maiandros and the headlong peaks of Mykale;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.870">of these the two leaders were Amphimachos and Nastes,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.871">Nastes and Amphimachos, the shining sons of Nomion.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.872">Nastes came like a girl to the fighting in golden raiment,</p>
	<p id="IL.2.873">poor fool, nor did this avail to keep dismal death back;</p>
	<p id="IL.2.874">but he went down under the hands of swift-running Aiakides</p>
	<p id="IL.2.875">in the river, and fiery Achilleus stripped the gold from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.2.876">Sarpedon with unfaulted Glaukos was lord of the Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.2.877">from Lykia far away, and the whirling waters of Xanthos.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.1">Now when the men of both sides were set in order by their leaders,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.2">the Trojans came on with clamour and shouting, like wildfowl,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.3">as when the clamour of cranes goes high to the heavens,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.4">when the cranes escape the winter time and the rains unceasing</p>
	<p id="IL.3.5">and clamorously wing their way to the streaming Ocean,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.6">bringing to the Pygmaian men bloodshed and destruction:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.7">at daybreak they bring on the baleful battle against them.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.8">But the Achaian men went silently, breathing valour,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.9">stubbornly minded each in his heart to stand by the others.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.10">As on the peaks of a mountain the south wind scatters the thick mist,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.11">no friend to the shepherd, but better than night for the robber,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.12">and a man can see before him only so far as a stone cast,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.13">so beneath their feet the dust drove up in a stormcloud</p>
	<p id="IL.3.14">of men marching, who made their way through the plain in great speed.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.15">Now as these in their advance had come close together,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.16">Alexandros the godlike leapt from the ranks of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.17">as challenger wearing across his shoulders the hide of a leopard,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.18">curved bow and sword; while in his hands shaking two javelins</p>
	<p id="IL.3.19">pointed with bronze, he challenged all the best of the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.3.20">to fight man to man against him in bitter combat.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.21">Now as soon as Menelaos the warlike caught sight of him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.22">making his way with long strides out in front of the army,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.23">he was glad, like a lion who comes on a mighty carcass,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.24">in his hunger chancing upon the body of a horned stag</p>
	<p id="IL.3.25">or wild goat; who eats it eagerly, although against him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.26">are hastening the hounds in their speed and the stalwart young men:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.27">thus Menelaos was happy finding godlike Alexandros</p>
	<p id="IL.3.28">there in front of his eyes, and thinking to punish the robber,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.29">straightway in all his armour he sprang to the ground from his chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.30">But Alexandros the godlike when he saw Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.3.31">showing among the champions, the heart was shaken within him;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.32">to avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.33">As a man who has come on a snake in the mountain valley</p>
	<p id="IL.3.34">suddenly steps back, and the shivers come over his body,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.35">and he draws back and away, cheeks seized with a green pallor;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.36">so in terror of Atreus' son godlike Alexandros</p>
	<p id="IL.3.37">lost himself again in the host of the haughty Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.38">But Hektor saw him and in words of shame rebuked him:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.39">'Evil Paris, beautiful, woman-crazy, cajoling,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.40">better had you never been born, or killed unwedded.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.41">Truly I could have wished it so; it would be far better</p>
	<p id="IL.3.42">than to have you with us to our shame, for others to sneer at.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.43">Surely now the flowing-haired Achaians laugh at us,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.44">thinking you are our bravest champion, only because your</p>
	<p id="IL.3.45">looks are handsome, but there is no strength in your heart, no courage.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.46">Were you like this that time when in sea-wandering vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.3.47">assembling oarsmen to help you you sailed over the water,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.48">and mixed with the outlanders, and carried away a fair woman</p>
	<p id="IL.3.49">from a remote land, whose lord's kin were spearmen and fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.50">to your father a big sorrow, and your city, and all your people,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.51">to yourself a thing shameful but bringing joy to the enemy?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.52">And now you would not stand up against warlike Menelaos?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.53">Thus you would learn of the man whose blossoming wife you have taken.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.54">The lyre would not help you then, nor the favours of Aphrodite,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.55">nor your locks, when you rolled in the dust, nor all your beauty.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.56">No, but the Trojans are cowards in truth, else long before this</p>
	<p id="IL.3.57">you had worn a mantle of flying stones for the wrong you did us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.58">Then in answer Alexandros the godlike spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.59">'Hektor, seeing you have scolded me rightly, not beyond measure--</p>
	<p id="IL.3.60">still, your heart forever is weariless, like an axe-blade</p>
	<p id="IL.3.61">driven by a man's strength through the timber, one who, well skilled,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.62">hews a piece for a ship, driven on by the force of a man's strength:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.63">such is the heart in your breast, unshakable: yet do not</p>
	<p id="IL.3.64">bring up against me the sweet favours of golden Aphrodite.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.65">Never to be cast away are the gifts of the gods, magnificent,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.66">which they give of their own will, no man could have them for wanting them.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.67">Now though, if you wish me to fight it out and do battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.68">make the rest of the Trojans sit down, and all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.69">and set me in the middle with Menelaos the warlike</p>
	<p id="IL.3.70">to fight together for the sake of Helen and all her possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.71">That one of us who wins and is proved stronger, let him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.72">take the possessions fairly and the woman, and lead her homeward.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.73">But the rest of you, having cut your oaths of faith and friendship,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.74">dwell, you in Troy where the soil is rich, while those others return home</p>
	<p id="IL.3.75">to horse-pasturing Argos, and Achaia the land of fair women.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.76">So he spoke, and Hektor hearing his word was happy</p>
	<p id="IL.3.77">and went into the space between and forced back the Trojan battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.3.78">holding his spear by the middle until they were all seated.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.79">But the flowing-haired Achaians kept pointing their bows at him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.80">with arrows and with flung stones striving ever to strike him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.81">until Agamemnon lord of men cried out in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.82">'Argives, hold: cast at him no longer, o sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.83">Hektor of the shining helm is trying to tell us something.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.84">So he spoke, and they stopped fighting and suddenly all fell</p>
	<p id="IL.3.85">silent; but Hektor between them spoke now to both sides:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.86">'Hear from me, Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians, the word</p>
	<p id="IL.3.87">of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.88">He would have all the rest of the Trojans and all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.3.89">lay aside on the bountiful earth their splendid armour</p>
	<p id="IL.3.90">while he himself in the middle and warlike Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.3.91">fight alone for the sake of Helen and all her possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.92">That one of them who wins and is proved stronger, let him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.93">take the possessions fairly and the woman, and lead her homeward</p>
	<p id="IL.3.94">while the rest of us cut our oaths of faith and friendship.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.95">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.96">but among them spoke out Menelaos of the great war cry:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.97">'Listen now to me also; since beyond all others this sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.3.98">comes closest to my heart, and I think the Argives and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.3.99">can go free of each other at last. You have suffered much evil</p>
	<p id="IL.3.100">for the sake of this my quarrel since Alexandros began it.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.101">As for that one of us two to whom death and doom are given,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.102">let him die: the rest of you be made friends with each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.103">Bring two lambs: let one be white and the other black for</p>
	<p id="IL.3.104">Earth and the Sun God, and for Zeus we will bring yet another.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.105">Bring, that he may seal the pledges, the strength of Priam:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.106">Priam himself, for his sons are outrageous, not to be trusted;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.107">lest some man overstep Zeus' oaths, and make them be nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.108">Always it is, that the hearts in the younger men are frivolous,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.109">but when an elder man is among them, he looks behind him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.110">and in front, so that all comes out far better for both sides.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.111">So he spoke, and the Trojans and Achaians were joyful,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.112">hoping now to be rid of all the sorrow of warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.113">They pulled their chariots into line, and themselves dismounted</p>
	<p id="IL.3.114">and stripped off their armour which was laid on the ground beside them,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.115">close together, so there was little ground left between them.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.116">Hektor sent away to the citadel two heralds</p>
	<p id="IL.3.117">lightly to bring down the lambs, and to summon Priam;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.118">and powerful Agamemnon in turn sent Talthybios</p>
	<p id="IL.3.119">to go down to the hollow ships, with orders to bring two</p>
	<p id="IL.3.120">lambs: he did not disobey the order of great Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.121">Now to Helen of the white arms came a messenger, Iris,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.122">in the likeness of her sister-in-law, the wife of Antenor's</p>
	<p id="IL.3.123">son, whom strong Helikaon wed, the son of Antenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.124">Laodike, loveliest looking of all the daughters of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.125">She came on Helen in the chamber; she was weaving a great web,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.126">a red folding robe, and working into it the numerous struggles</p>
	<p id="IL.3.127">of Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.128">struggles that they endured for her sake at the hands of the war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.129">Iris of the swift feet stood beside her and spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.130">'Come with me, dear girl, to behold the marvellous things done</p>
	<p id="IL.3.131">by Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.132">who just now carried sorrowful war against each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.133">in the plain, and all their desire was for deadly fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.134">now they are all seated in silence, the fighting has ended;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.135">they lean on their shields, the tall spears stuck in the ground beside them.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.136">But Menelaos the warlike and Alexandros will fight</p>
	<p id="IL.3.137">with long spears against each other for your possession.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.138">You shall be called beloved wife of the man who wins you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.139">Speaking so the goddess left in her heart sweet longing</p>
	<p id="IL.3.140">after her husband of time before, and her city and parents.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.141">And at once, wrapping herself about in shimmering garments,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.142">she went forth from the chamber, letting fall a light tear;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.143">not by herself, since two handmaidens went to attend her,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.144">Aithre, Pitteus' daughter, and Klymene of the ox eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.145">Rapidly they came to the place where the Skaian gates stood.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.146">Now those who sat with Priam: Panthoös and Thymoites,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.147">Lampos and Klytios, Hiketaon, scion of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.148">with Antenor and Oukalegon, both men of good counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.149">these were seated by the Skaian gates, elders of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.150">Now through old age these fought no longer, yet were they excellent</p>
	<p id="IL.3.151">speakers still, and clear, as cicadas who through the forest</p>
	<p id="IL.3.152">settle on trees, to issue their delicate voice of singing.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.153">Such were they who sat on the tower, chief men of the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.154">And these, as they saw Helen along the tower approaching,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.155">murmuring softly to each other uttered their winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.156">'Surely there is no blame on Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.3.157">if for long time they suffer hardship for a woman like this one.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.158">Terrible is the likeness of her face to immortal goddesses.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.159">Still, though she be such, let her go away in the ships, lest</p>
	<p id="IL.3.160">she be left behind, a grief to us and our children.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.161">So they spoke: but Priam aloud called out to Helen:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.162">'Come over where I am, dear child, and sit down beside me,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.163">to look at your husband of time past, your friends and your people.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.164">I am not blaming you: to me the gods are blameworthy</p>
	<p id="IL.3.165">who drove upon me this sorrowful war against the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.166">So you could tell me the name of this man who is so tremendous;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.167">who is this Achaian man of power and stature?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.168">Though in truth there are others taller by a head than he is,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.169">yet these eyes have never yet looked on a man so splendid</p>
	<p id="IL.3.170">nor so lordly as this: such a man might well be royal.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.171">Helen, the shining among women, answered and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.172">'Always to me, beloved father, you are feared and respected;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.173">and I wish bitter death had been what I wanted, when I came hither</p>
	<p id="IL.3.174">following your son, forsaking my chamber, my kinsmen,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.175">my grown child, and the loveliness of girls my own age.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.176">It did not happen that way: and now I am worn with weeping.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.177">This now I will tell you in answer to the question you asked me.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.178">That man is Atreus' son Agamemnon, widely powerful,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.179">at the same time a good king and a strong spearfighter,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.180">once my kinsman, slut that I am. Did this ever happen?'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.181">This she said, and the old man spoke again, wondering at him:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.182">'O son of Atreus, blessed, child of fortune and favour,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.183">many are these beneath your sway, these sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.184">Once before this time I visited Phrygia of the vineyards.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.185">There I looked on the Phrygian men with their swarming horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.186">so many of them, the people of Otreus and godlike Mygdon,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.187">whose camp was spread at that time along the banks of Sangarios:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.188">and I myself, a helper in war, was marshalled among them</p>
	<p id="IL.3.189">on that day when the Amazon women came, men's equals.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.190">Yet even they were not so many as these glancing-eyed Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.191">Next again the old man asked her, seeing Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.192">'Tell me of this one also, dear child; what man can he be,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.193">shorter in truth by a head than Atreus' son Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.194">but broader, it would seem, in the chest and across the shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.195">Now as his armour lies piled on the prospering earth, still he</p>
	<p id="IL.3.196">ranges, like some ram, through the marshalled ranks of the fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.197">Truly, to some deep-fleeced ram would I liken him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.198">who makes his way through the great mass of the shining sheep-flocks.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.199">Helen, the daughter descended of Zeus, spoke then in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.200">'This one is Laertes' son, resourceful Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.201">who grew up in the country, rough though it be, of Ithaka,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.202">to know every manner of shiftiness and crafty counsels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.203">In his turn Antenor of the good counsel answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.204">'Surely this word you have spoken, my lady, can be no falsehood.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.205">Once in the days before now brilliant Odysseus came here</p>
	<p id="IL.3.206">with warlike Menelaos, and their embassy was for your sake.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.207">To both of these I gave in my halls kind entertainment</p>
	<p id="IL.3.208">and I learned the natural way of both, and their close counsels.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.209">Now when these were set before the Trojans assembled</p>
	<p id="IL.3.210">and stood up, Menelaos was bigger by his broad shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.3.211">but Odysseus was the more lordly when both were seated.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.212">Now before all when both of them spun their speech and their counsels,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.213">Menelaos indeed spoke rapidly, in few words</p>
	<p id="IL.3.214">but exceedingly lucid, since he was no long speaker</p>
	<p id="IL.3.215">nor one who wasted his words though he was only a young man.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.216">But when that other drove to his feet, resourceful Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.217">he would just stand and stare down, eyes fixed on the ground beneath him,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.218">nor would he gesture with the staff backward and forward, but hold it</p>
	<p id="IL.3.219">clutched hard in front of him, like any man who knows nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.220">Yes, you would call him a sullen man, and a fool likewise.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.221">But when he let the great voice go from his chest, and the words came</p>
	<p id="IL.3.222">drifting down like the winter snows, then no other mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.3.223">man beside could stand up against Odysseus. Then we</p>
	<p id="IL.3.224">wondered less beholding Odysseus' outward appearance.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.225">Third in order, looking at Aias, the old man asked her:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.226">'Who then is this other Achaian of power and stature</p>
	<p id="IL.3.227">towering above the Argives by head and broad shoulders?'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.228">Helen with the light robes and shining among women answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.229">'That one is gigantic Aias, wall of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.230">and beyond him there is Idomeneus like a god standing</p>
	<p id="IL.3.231">among the Kretans, and the lords of Krete are gathered about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.232">Many a time warlike Menelaos would entertain him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.233">in our own house when he came over from Krete. And I see them</p>
	<p id="IL.3.234">all now, all the rest of the glancing-eyed Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.235">all whom I would know well by sight, whose names I could tell you,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.236">yet nowhere can I see those two, the marshals of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.237">Kastor, breaker of horses, and the strong boxer, Polydeukes,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.238">my own brothers, born with me of a single mother.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.239">Perhaps these came not with the rest from Lakedaimon the lovely,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.240">or else they did come here in their sea-wandering ships, yet</p>
	<p id="IL.3.241">now they are reluctant to go with the men into battle</p>
	<p id="IL.3.242">dreading the words of shame and all the reproach that is on me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.243">So she spoke, but the teeming earth lay already upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.3.244">away in Lakedaimon, the beloved land of their fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.245">Now through the town the heralds brought the symbols of oaths pledged,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.246">two young rams, and cheerful wine, the yield of the tilled land</p>
	<p id="IL.3.247">in a goatskin wine sack, while another carried the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.3.248">mixing bowl (the herald Idaios) and the golden wine-cups.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.249">Standing beside the aged man he spoke words to arouse him:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.250">'Son of Laomedon, rise up: you are called by the chief men</p>
	<p id="IL.3.251">of Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.3.252">to come down into the plain that you may seal the oaths pledged.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.253">For warlike Menelaos and Alexandros are to fight</p>
	<p id="IL.3.254">with long spears against each other for the sake of the woman.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.255">Let the woman go to the winner, and all the possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.256">Let the rest of them, cutting their oaths of faith and friendship,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.257">dwell, we in Troy where the soil is rich, while those others return home</p>
	<p id="IL.3.258">to horse-pasturing Argos and Achaia the land of fair women.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.259">So he spoke, and the old man shuddered, but called his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.3.260">to yoke the horses to the car, and they promptly obeyed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.261">And Priam mounted into the car and gathered the reins back</p>
	<p id="IL.3.262">as Antenor beside him stepped into the fair-wrought chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.263">Through the Skaian gates to the plain they steered the swift horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.264">Now when these had come among the Trojans and Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.265">they stepped down on the prospering earth from their car with horses</p>
	<p id="IL.3.266">and made their way striding among the Achaians and Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.267">On the other side rose up the lord of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.268">and the resourceful Odysseus rose up. Meanwhile the proud heralds</p>
	<p id="IL.3.269">led up the victims for the gods' oaths, and in a great wine-bowl</p>
	<p id="IL.3.270">mixed the wine, and poured water over the hands of the princes.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.271">Atreus' son laid hands upon his work-knife, and drew it</p>
	<p id="IL.3.272">from where it hung ever beside the mighty sheath of his war sword</p>
	<p id="IL.3.273">and cut off hairs from the heads of the lambs; and the heralds thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.3.274">passed these about to all the princes of the Trojans and Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.275">Atreus' son uplifting his hands then prayed in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.276">'Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.277">and Helios, you who see all things, who listen to all things,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.278">earth, and rivers, and you who under the earth take vengeance</p>
	<p id="IL.3.279">on dead men, whoever among them has sworn to falsehood,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.280">you shall be witnesses, to guard the oaths of fidelity.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.281">If it should be that Alexandros slays Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.282">let him keep Helen for himself, and all her possessions,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.283">and we in our seafaring ships shall take our wayhomeward.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.284">But if the fair-haired Menelaos kills Alexandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.285">then let the Trojans give back Helen and all her possessions,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.286">and pay also a price to the Argives which will be fitting,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.287">which among people yet to come shall be as a standard.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.288">Then if Priam and the sons of Priam are yet unwilling</p>
	<p id="IL.3.289">after Alexandros has fallen to pay me the penalty,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.290">I myself shall fight hereafter for the sake of the ransom,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.291">here remaining, until I have won to the end of my quarrel.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.292">So he spoke, and with pitiless bronze he cut the lambs' throats,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.293">letting them fall gasping again to the ground, the life breath</p>
	<p id="IL.3.294">going away, since the strength of the bronze had taken it from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.295">Drawing the wine from the mixing bowls in the cups, they poured it</p>
	<p id="IL.3.296">forth, and made their prayer to the gods who live everlasting.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.297">And thus would murmur any man, Achaian or Trojan:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.298">'Zeus, exalted and mightiest, and you other immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.299">let those, whichever side they may be, who do wrong to the oaths sworn</p>
	<p id="IL.3.300">first, let their brains be spilled on the ground as this wine is spilled now,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.301">theirs and their sons', and let their wives be the spoil of others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.302">They spoke, but none of this would the son of Kronos accomplish.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.303">Now among them spoke Priam descended of Dardanos also:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.304">'Listen to me, you Trojans and you strong-greaved Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.305">Now I am going away to windy Ilion, homeward,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.306">since I cannot look with these eyes on the sight of my dear son</p>
	<p id="IL.3.307">fighting against warlike Menelaos in single combat.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.308">Zeus knows--maybe he knows--and the rest of the gods immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.3.309">for which of the two death is appointed to end this matter.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.310">He spoke, a godlike man, and laid the lambs in the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.311">and mounted into it himself, and pulled the reins backward.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.312">Antenor beside him stepped up into the fair-wrought chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.313">These two took their way backward and made for Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.314">Hektor now, the son of Priam, and brilliant Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.3.315">measured out the distance first, and thereafter picked up</p>
	<p id="IL.3.316">two lots, and put them in a brazen helmet, and shook them,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.317">to see which one of the two should be first to cast with his bronze spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.318">and the people on each side held up their hands to the gods, and prayed</p>
	<p id="IL.3.319">to them. Thus would murmur any man, Achaian or Trojan:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.320">'Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.321">whichever man has made what has happened happen to both sides,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.322">grant that he be killed and go down to the house of Hades.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.323">Let the friendship and the sworn faith be true for the rest of us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.324">So they spoke, and tall Hektor of the shining helm shook</p>
	<p id="IL.3.325">the lots, looking backward, and at once Paris' lot was outshaken.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.326">All the rest sat down in their ranks on the ground, at the place where</p>
	<p id="IL.3.327">the glittering armour of each was piled by his light-footed horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.328">while one of them put about his shoulders his splendid armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.329">brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.330">First he placed along his legs the fair greaves linked with</p>
	<p id="IL.3.331">silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.332">Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet</p>
	<p id="IL.3.333">of Lykaon his brother since this fitted him also.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.334">Across his shoulders he slung the sword with the nails of silver,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.335">a bronze sword, and above it the great shield, huge and heavy.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.336">Over his powerful head he set the well-fashioned helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.3.337">with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.338">He took up a strong-shafted spear that fitted his hand's grip.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.339">In the same way warlike Menelaos put on his armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.340">Now when these two were armed on either side of the battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.341">they strode into the space between the Achaians and Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.342">looking terror at each other; and amazement seized the beholders,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.343">Trojans, breakers of horses, and strong-greaved Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.344">They took their stand in the measured space not far from each other</p>
	<p id="IL.3.345">raging each at the other man and shaking their spearshafts.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.346">First of the two Alexandros let go his spear far-shadowing</p>
	<p id="IL.3.347">and struck the shield of Atreus' son on its perfect circle</p>
	<p id="IL.3.348">nor did the bronze point break its way through, but the spearhead bent back</p>
	<p id="IL.3.349">in the strong shield. And after him Atreus' son, Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.3.350">was ready to let go the bronze spear, with a prayer to Zeus father:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.351">'Zeus, lord, grant me to punish the man who first did me injury,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.352">brilliant Alexandros, and beat him down under my hands' strength</p>
	<p id="IL.3.353">that any one of the men to come may shudder to think of</p>
	<p id="IL.3.354">doing evil to a kindly host, who has given him friendship.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.355">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it</p>
	<p id="IL.3.356">and struck the shield of Priam's son on its perfect circle.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.357">All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.3.358">and smashed its way through the intricately worked corselet;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.359">straight ahead by the flank the spearhead shore through his tunic,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.360">yet he bent away to one side and avoided the dark death.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.361">Drawing his sword with the silver nails, the son of Atreus</p>
	<p id="IL.3.362">heaving backward struck at the horn of his helmet; the sword-blade</p>
	<p id="IL.3.363">three times broken and four times broken fell from his hand's grip.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.364">Groaning, the son of Atreus lifted his eyes to the wide sky:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.365">'Father Zeus, no God beside is more baleful than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.366">Here I thought to punish Alexandros for his wickedness;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.367">and now my sword is broken in my hands, and the spear flew vainly</p>
	<p id="IL.3.368">out of my hands on the throw before, and I have not hit him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.369">He spoke, and flashing forward laid hold of the horse-haired helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.3.370">and spun him about, and dragged him away toward the strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.371">for the broidered strap under the softness of his throat strangled Paris,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.372">fastened under his chin to hold on the horned helmet.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.373">Now he would have dragged him away and won glory forever</p>
	<p id="IL.3.374">had not Aphrodite daughter of Zeus watched sharply.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.375">She broke the chinstrap, made from the hide of a slaughtered bullock,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.376">and the helmet came away empty in the heavy hand of Atreides.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.377">The hero whirled the helmet about and sent it flying</p>
	<p id="IL.3.378">among the strong-greaved Achaians, and his staunch companions retrieved it.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.379">He turned and made again for his man, determined to kill him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.380">with the bronze spear. But Aphrodite caught up Paris</p>
	<p id="IL.3.381">easily, since she was divine, and wrapped him in a thick mist</p>
	<p id="IL.3.382">and set him down again in his own perfumed bedchamber.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.383">She then went away to summon Helen, and found her</p>
	<p id="IL.3.384">on the high tower, with a cluster of Trojan women about her.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.385">She laid her hand upon the robe immortal, and shook it,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.386">and spoke to her, likening herself to an aged woman,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.387">a wool-dresser who when she was living in Lakedaimon</p>
	<p id="IL.3.388">made beautiful things out of wool, and loved her beyond all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.389">Likening herself to this woman Aphrodite spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.390">'Come with me: Alexandros sends for you to come home to him.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.391">He is in his chamber now, in the bed with its circled pattern,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.392">shining in his raiment and his own beauty; you would not think</p>
	<p id="IL.3.393">that he came from fighting against a man; you would think he was going</p>
	<p id="IL.3.394">rather to a dance, or rested and had been dancing lately.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.395">So she spoke, and troubled the spirit in Helen's bosom.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.396">She, as she recognized the round, sweet throat of the goddess</p>
	<p id="IL.3.397">and her desirable breasts and her eyes that were full of shining,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.398">she wondered, and spoke a word and called her by name, thus:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.399">'Strange divinity! Why are you still so stubborn to beguile me?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.400">Will you carry me further yet somewhere among cities</p>
	<p id="IL.3.401">fairly settled? In Phrygia or in lovely Maionia?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.402">Is there some mortal man there also who is dear to you?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.403">Is it because Menelaos has beaten great Alexandros</p>
	<p id="IL.3.404">and wishes, hateful even as I am, to carry me homeward,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.405">is it for this that you stand in your treachery now beside me?</p>
	<p id="IL.3.406">Go yourself and sit beside him, abandon the gods' way,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.407">turn your feet back never again to the path of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.3.408">but stay with him forever, and suffer for him, and look after him</p>
	<p id="IL.3.409">until he makes you his wedded wife, or makes you his slave girl.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.410">Not I. I am not going to him. It would be too shameful.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.411">I will not serve his bed, since the Trojan women hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.3.412">would laugh at me, all, and my heart even now is confused with sorrows.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.413">Then in anger Aphrodite the shining spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.414">'Wretched girl, do not tease me lest in anger I forsake you</p>
	<p id="IL.3.415">and grow to hate you as much as now I terribly love you,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.416">lest I encompass you in hard hate, caught between both sides,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.417">Danaans and Trojans alike, and you wretchedly perish.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.418">So she spoke, and Helen daughter of Zeus was frightened</p>
	<p id="IL.3.419">and went, shrouding herself about in the luminous spun robe,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.420">silent, unseen by the Trojan women, and led by the goddess.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.421">When they had come to Alexandros' splendidly wrought house,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.422">the rest of them, the handmaidens went speedily to their own work,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.423">but she, shining among women, went to the high-vaulted bedchamber.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.424">Aphrodite the sweetly laughing drew up an armchair,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.425">carrying it, she, a goddess, and set it before Alexandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.426">and Helen, daughter of Zeus of the aegis, took her place there</p>
	<p id="IL.3.427">turning her eyes away, and spoke to her lord in derision:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.428">'So you came back from fighting. Oh, how I wish you had died there</p>
	<p id="IL.3.429">beaten down by the stronger man, who was once my husband.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.430">There was a time before now you boasted that you were better</p>
	<p id="IL.3.431">than warlike Menelaos, in spear and hand and your own strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.432">Go forth now and challenge warlike Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.3.433">once again to fight you in combat. But no: I advise you</p>
	<p id="IL.3.434">rather to let it be, and fight no longer with fair-haired</p>
	<p id="IL.3.435">Menelaos, strength against strength in single combat</p>
	<p id="IL.3.436">recklessly. You might very well go down before his spear.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.437">Paris then in turn spoke to her thus and answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.438">'Lady, censure my heart no more in bitter reprovals.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.439">This time Menelaos with Athene's help has beaten me;</p>
	<p id="IL.3.440">another time I shall beat him. We have gods on our side also.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.441">Come, then, rather let us go to bed and turn to love-making.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.442">Never before as now has passion enmeshed my senses,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.443">not when I took you the first time from Lakedaimon the lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.3.444">and caught you up and carried you away in seafaring vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.445">and lay with you in the bed of love on the island Kranae,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.446">not even then, as now, did I love you and sweet desire seize me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.447">Speaking, he led the way to the bed; and his wife went with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.448">So these two were laid in the carven bed. But Atreides</p>
	<p id="IL.3.449">ranged like a wild beast up and down the host, to discover</p>
	<p id="IL.3.450">whether he could find anywhere godlike Alexandros.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.451">Yet could none of the Trojans nor any renowned companion</p>
	<p id="IL.3.452">show Alexandros then to warlike Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.453">These would not have hidden him for love, if any had seen him,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.454">since he was hated among them all as dark death is hated.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.455">Now among them spoke forth the lord of men Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.456">'Listen to me, o Trojans, Dardanians and companions:</p>
	<p id="IL.3.457">clearly the victory is with warlike Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.3.458">Do you therefore give back, with all her possessions, Helen</p>
	<p id="IL.3.459">of Argos, and pay a price that shall be befitting,</p>
	<p id="IL.3.460">which among people yet to come shall be as a standard.'</p>
	<p id="IL.3.461">So spoke Atreus' son, and the other Achaians applauded him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.1">Now the gods at the side of Zeus were sitting in council</p>
	<p id="IL.4.2">over the golden floor, and among them the goddess Hebe</p>
	<p id="IL.4.3">poured them nectar as wine, while they in the golden drinking-cups</p>
	<p id="IL.4.4">drank to each other, gazing down on the city of the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.5">Presently the son of Kronos was minded to anger</p>
	<p id="IL.4.6">Hera, if he could, with words offensive, speaking to cross her:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.7">'Two among the goddesses stand by Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.8">Hera of Argos, and Athene who stands by her people.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.9">Yet see, here they are sitting apart, looking on at the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.10">and take their pleasure. Meanwhile laughing Aphrodite forever</p>
	<p id="IL.4.11">stands by her man and drives the spirits of death away from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.12">Even now she has rescued him when he thought he would perish.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.13">So, the victory now is with warlike Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.14">Let us consider then how these things shall be accomplished,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.15">whether again to stir up grim warfare and the terrible</p>
	<p id="IL.4.16">fighting, or cast down love and make them friends with each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.17">If somehow this way could be sweet and pleasing to all of us,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.18">the city of lord Priam might still be a place men dwell in,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.19">and Menelaos could take away with him Helen of Argos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.20">So he spoke; and Athene and Hera muttered, since they were</p>
	<p id="IL.4.21">sitting close to each other, devising evil for the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.22">Still Athene stayed silent and said nothing, but only</p>
	<p id="IL.4.23">sulked at Zeus her father, and savage anger took hold of her.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.24">But the heart of Hera could not contain her anger, and she spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.25">'Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.26">How can you wish to make wasted and fruitless all this endeavour,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.27">the sweat that I have sweated in toil, and my horses worn out</p>
	<p id="IL.4.28">gathering my people, and bringing evil to Priam and his children.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.29">Do it then; but not all the rest of us gods will approve you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.30">Deeply troubled, Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.31">'Dear lady, what can be all the great evils done to you</p>
	<p id="IL.4.32">by Priam and the sons of Priam, that you are thus furious</p>
	<p id="IL.4.33">forever to bring down the strong-founded city of Ilion?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.34">If you could walk through the gates and through the towering ramparts</p>
	<p id="IL.4.35">and eat Priam and the children of Priam raw, and the other</p>
	<p id="IL.4.36">Trojans, then, then only might you glut at last your anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.37">Do as you please then. Never let this quarrel hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.4.38">be between you and me a bitterness for both of us.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.39">And put away in your thoughts this other thing that I tell you:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.40">whenever I in turn am eager to lay waste some city,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.41">as I please, one in which are dwelling men who are dear to you,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.42">you shall not stand in the way of my anger, but let me do it,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.43">since I was willing to grant you this with my heart unwilling.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.44">For of all the cities beneath the sun and the starry heaven</p>
	<p id="IL.4.45">dwelt in by men who live upon earth, there has never been one</p>
	<p id="IL.4.46">honoured nearer to my heart than sacred Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.4.47">and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.48">Never yet has my altar gone without fair sacrifice,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.49">the libation and the savour, since this is our portion of honour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.50">Then the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.51">'Of all cities there are three that are dearest to my own heart:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.52">Argos and Sparta and Mykenai of the wide ways. All these,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.53">whenever they become hateful to your heart, sack utterly.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.54">I will not stand up for these against you, nor yet begrudge you.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.55">Yet if even so I bear malice and would not have you destroy them,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.56">in malice I will accomplish nothing, since you are far stronger.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.57">Yet my labour also should not be let go unaccomplished;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.58">I am likewise a god, and my race is even what yours is,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.59">and I am first of the daughters of devious-devising Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.60">both ways, since I am eldest born and am called your consort,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.61">yours, and you in turn are lord over all the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.62">Come then, in this thing let us both give way to each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.63">I to you, you to me, and so the rest of the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.4.64">gods will follow. Now in speed give orders to Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.4.65">to visit horrible war again on Achaians and Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.66">and try to make it so that the Trojans are first offenders</p>
	<p id="IL.4.67">to do injury against the oaths to the far-famed Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.68">She spoke, nor did the father of gods and men disobey her,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.69">but immediately he spoke in winged words to Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.70">'Go now swiftly to the host of the Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.4.71">and try to make it so that the Trojans are first offenders</p>
	<p id="IL.4.72">to do injury against the oaths to the far-famed Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.73">Speaking so he stirred up Athene, who was eager before this,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.74">and she went in a flash of speed down the pinnacles of Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.75">As when the son of devious-devising Kronos casts down</p>
	<p id="IL.4.76">a star, portent to sailors or to widespread armies of peoples</p>
	<p id="IL.4.77">glittering, and thickly the sparks of fire break from it,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.78">in such likeness Pallas Athene swept flashing earthward</p>
	<p id="IL.4.79">and plunged between the two hosts; and amazement seized the beholders,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.80">Trojans, breakers of horses, and strong-greaved Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.81">And thus they would speak to each other, each looking at the man next him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.82">'Surely again there will be evil war and terrible</p>
	<p id="IL.4.83">fighting, or else now friendship is being set between both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.4.84">by Zeus, who is appointed lord of the wars of mortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.85">Thus would murmur any man, Achaian or Trojan.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.86">She in the likeness of a man merged among the Trojans assembled,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.87">Laodokos, Antenor's son, a powerful spearman,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.88">searching for godlike Pandaros, if she might somewhere come on him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.89">She found the son of Lykaon, a man blameless and powerful,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.90">standing still, and about him were the ranks of strong, shield-armoured</p>
	<p id="IL.4.91">people, who had followed him from the streams of Aisepos.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.92">Speaking in winged words she stood beside him and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.93">'Wise son of Lykaon, would you now let me persuade you?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.94">So you might dare send a flying arrow against Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.4.95">and win you glory and gratitude in the sight of all Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.96">particularly beyond all else with prince Alexandros.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.97">Beyond all beside you would carry away glorious gifts from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.98">were he to see warlike Menelaos, the son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.99">struck down by your arrow, and laid on the sorrowful corpse-fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.100">Come then, let go an arrow against haughty Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.101">but make your prayer to Apollo the light-born, the glorious archer,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.102">that you will accomplish a grand sacrifice of lambs first born</p>
	<p id="IL.4.103">when you come home again to the city of sacred Zeleia.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.104">So spoke Athene, and persuaded the fool's heart in him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.105">Straightway he unwrapped his bow, of the polished horn from</p>
	<p id="IL.4.106">a running wild goat he himself had shot in the chest once,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.107">lying in wait for the goat in a covert as it stepped down</p>
	<p id="IL.4.108">from the rock, and hit it in the chest so it sprawled on the boulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.109">The horns that grew from the goat's head were sixteen palms' length.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.110">A bowyer working on the horn then bound them together,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.111">smoothing them to a fair surface, and put on a golden string hook.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.112">Pandaros strung his bow and put it in position, bracing it</p>
	<p id="IL.4.113">against the ground, and his brave friends held their shields in front of him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.114">for fear the warlike sons of the Achaians might rise up and rush him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.115">before he had struck warlike Menelaos, the son of Atreus.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.116">He stripped away the lid of the quiver, and took out an arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.4.117">feathered, and never shot before, transmitter of dark pain.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.118">Swiftly he arranged the bitter arrow along the bowstring,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.119">and made his prayer to Apollo the light-born, the glorious archer,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.120">that he would accomplish a grand sacrifice of lambs first born</p>
	<p id="IL.4.121">when he came home again to the city of sacred Zeleia.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.122">He drew, holding at once the grooves and the ox-hide bowstring</p>
	<p id="IL.4.123">and brought the string against his nipple, iron to the bowstave.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.124">But when he had pulled the great weapon till it made a circle,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.125">the bow groaned, and the string sang high, and the arrow, sharp-pointed,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.126">leapt away, furious, to fly through the throng before it.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.127">Still the blessed gods immortal did not forget you,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.128">Menelaos, and first among them Zeus' daughter, the spoiler,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.129">who standing in front of you fended aside the tearing arrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.130">She brushed it away from his skin as lightly as when a mother</p>
	<p id="IL.4.131">brushes a fly away from her child who is lying in sweet sleep,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.132">steering herself the arrow's course straight to where the golden</p>
	<p id="IL.4.133">belt buckles joined and the halves of his corselet were fitted together.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.134">The bitter arrow was driven against the joining of the war belt</p>
	<p id="IL.4.135">and passed clean through the war belt elaborately woven;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.136">into the elaborately wrought corselet the shaft was driven</p>
	<p id="IL.4.137">and the guard which he wore to protect his skin and keep the spears off,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.138">which guarded him best, yet the arrow plunged even through this also</p>
	<p id="IL.4.139">and with the very tip of its point it grazed the man's skin</p>
	<p id="IL.4.140">and straightway from the cut there gushed a cloud of dark blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.141">As when some Maionian woman or Karian with purple</p>
	<p id="IL.4.142">colours ivory, to make it a cheek piece for horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.143">it lies away in an inner room, and many a rider</p>
	<p id="IL.4.144">longs to have it, but it is laid up to be a king's treasure,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.145">two things, to be the beauty of the horse, the pride of the horseman:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.146">so, Menelaos, your shapely thighs were stained with the colour</p>
	<p id="IL.4.147">of blood, and your legs also and the ankles beneath them.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.148">Agamemnon the lord of men was taken with shuddering</p>
	<p id="IL.4.149">fear as he saw how from the cut the dark blood trickled downward,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.150">and Menelaos the warlike himself shuddered in terror;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.151">but when he saw the binding strings and the hooked barbs outside</p>
	<p id="IL.4.152">the wound, his spirit was gathered again back into him. Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.4.153">the powerful spoke to them, groaning heavily, and by the hand held</p>
	<p id="IL.4.154">Menelaos, while their companions were mourning beside them:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.155">'Dear brother, it was your death I sealed in the oaths of friendship,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.156">setting you alone before the Achaians to fight with the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.157">So, the Trojans have struck you down and trampled on the oaths sworn.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.158">Still the oaths and the blood of the lambs shall not be called vain,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.159">the unmixed wine poured and the right hands we trusted.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.160">If the Olympian at once has not finished this matter,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.161">late will he bring it to pass, and they must pay a great penalty,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.162">with their own heads, and with their women, and with their children.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.163">For I know this thing well in my heart, and my mind knows it.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.164">There will come a day when sacred Ilion shall perish,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.165">and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.166">and Zeus son of Kronos who sits on high, the sky-dwelling,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.167">himself shall shake the gloom of his aegis over all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.168">in anger for this deception. All this shall not go unaccomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.169">But I shall suffer a terrible grief for you, Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.170">if you die and fill out the destiny of your lifetime.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.171">And I must return a thing of reproach to Argos the thirsty,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.172">for now at once the Achaians will remember the land of their fathers;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.173">and thus we would leave to Priam and to the Trojans Helen</p>
	<p id="IL.4.174">of Argos, to glory over, while the bones of you rot in the ploughland</p>
	<p id="IL.4.175">as you lie dead in Troy, on a venture that went unaccomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.176">And thus shall some Trojan speak in the proud show of his manhood,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.177">leaping lightly as he speaks on the tomb of great Menelaos:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.178">"Might Agamemnon accomplish his anger thus against all his</p>
	<p id="IL.4.179">enemies, as now he led here in vain a host of Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.4.180">and has gone home again to the beloved land of his fathers</p>
	<p id="IL.4.181">with ships empty, and leaving behind him brave Menelaos."</p>
	<p id="IL.4.182">Thus shall a man speak: then let the wide earth open to take me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.183">Then in encouragement fair-haired Menelaos spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.184">'Do not fear, nor yet make afraid the Achaian people.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.185">The sharp arrow is not stuck in a mortal place, but the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.4.186">war belt turned it aside from its course, and the flap beneath it</p>
	<p id="IL.4.187">with my guard of armour that bronze-smiths wronght carefully for me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.188">Then in answer again spoke powerful Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.189">'May it only be as you say, o Menelaos, dear brother!</p>
	<p id="IL.4.190">But the physician will handle the wound and apply over it</p>
	<p id="IL.4.191">healing salves, by which he can put an end to the black pains.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.192">He spoke, and addressed Talthybios, his sacred herald:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.193">'Talthybios, with all speed go call hither Machaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.194">a man who is son of Asklepios and a blameless physician,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.195">so that he may look at Menelaos, the warlike son of</p>
	<p id="IL.4.196">Atreus, whom someone skilled in the bow's use shot with an arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.197">Trojan or Lykian: glory to him, but to us a sorrow.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.198">He spoke, and the herald heard and did not disobey him,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.199">but went on his way among the host of bronze-armoured Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.4.200">looking about for the warrior Machaon; and saw him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.201">standing still, and about him the strong ranks of shield-bearing</p>
	<p id="IL.4.202">people, who had come with him from horse-pasturing Trikka.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.203">He came and stood close beside him and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.204">'Rise up, son of Asklepios; powerful Agamemnon calls you,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.205">so that you may look at warlike Menelaos, the Achaians'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.206">leader, whom someone skilled in the bow's use shot with an arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.207">Trojan or Lykian: glory to him, but to us a sorrow.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.208">So he spoke, and stirred up the spirit within Machaon.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.209">They went through the crowd along the widespread host of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.210">But when they had come to the place where fair-haired Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.4.211">had been hit, where all the great men were gathered about him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.212">in a circle, and he stood in the midst of them, a man godlike,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.213">straightway he pulled the arrow forth from the joining of the war belt,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.214">and as it was pulled out the sharp barbs were broken backwards.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.215">He slipped open the war belt then and the flap beneath it</p>
	<p id="IL.4.216">with the guard of armour that bronze-smiths wrought carefully for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.217">But when he saw the wound where the bitter arrow was driven,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.218">he sucked the blood and in skill laid healing medicines on it</p>
	<p id="IL.4.219">that Cheiron in friendship long ago had given his father.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.220">While they were working over Menelaos of the great war cry</p>
	<p id="IL.4.221">all this time came on the ranks of the armoured Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.222">The Achaians again put on their armour, and remembered their warcraft.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.223">Then you would not have seen brilliant Agamemnon asleep nor</p>
	<p id="IL.4.224">skulking aside, nor in any way a reluctant fighter,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.225">but driving eagerly toward the fighting where men win glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.226">He left aside his chariot gleaming with bronze, and his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.227">and these, breathing hard, were held aside by a henchman,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.228">Eurymedon, born to Ptolemaios, the son of Peiraios.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.229">Agamemnon told him to keep them well in hand, till the time came</p>
	<p id="IL.4.230">when weariness might take hold of his limbs, through marshalling so many.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.231">Then he, on foot as he was, ranged through the ranks of his fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.232">Those of the fast-mounted Danaans he found eager, he would</p>
	<p id="IL.4.233">stand beside these and urge them harder on with words spoken:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.234">'Argives, do not let go now of this furious valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.235">Zeus the father shall not be one to give aid to liars,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.236">but these, who were the first to do violence over the oaths sworn,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.237">vultures shall feed upon the delicate skin of their bodies,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.238">while we lead away their beloved wives and innocent</p>
	<p id="IL.4.239">children, in our ships, after we have stormed their citadel.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.240">Any he might see hanging back from the hateful conflict</p>
	<p id="IL.4.241">these in words of anger he would reproach very bitterly:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.242">'Argives, you arrow-fighters, have you no shame, you abuses?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.243">Why are you simply standing there bewildered, like young deer</p>
	<p id="IL.4.244">who after they are tired from running through a great meadow</p>
	<p id="IL.4.245">stand there still, and there is no heart of courage within them?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.246">Thus are you standing still bewildered and are not fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.247">Or are you waiting for the Trojans to come close, where the strong-sterned</p>
	<p id="IL.4.248">ships have been hauled up along the strand of the grey sea,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.249">so you may know if Kronos' son will hold his hand over you?'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.250">Thus he ranged through the ranks of his men and set them in order.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.251">On his way through the thronging men he came to the Kretans</p>
	<p id="IL.4.252">who about valiant Idomeneus were arming for battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.253">Idomeneus, like a boar in his strength, stood among the champions</p>
	<p id="IL.4.254">while Meriones still urged along the last battalions.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.255">Agamemnon the lord of men was glad as he looked at them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.256">and in words of graciousness at once spoke to Idomeneus:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.257">'I honour you, Idomeneus, beyond the fast-mounted</p>
	<p id="IL.4.258">Danaans whether in battle, or in any action whatever,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.259">whether it be at the feast, when the great men of the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.4.260">blend in the mixing bowl the gleaming wine of the princes.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.261">Even though all the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.4.262">drink out their portion, still your cup stands filled forever</p>
	<p id="IL.4.263">even as mine, for you to drink when the pleasure takes you.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.264">Rise up then to battle, be such as you claimed in time past.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.265">Then in turn Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.266">'Son of Atreus, I will in truth be a staunch companion</p>
	<p id="IL.4.267">in arms, as first I promised you and bent my head to it.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.268">Rouse up rather the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.4.269">so that we may fight in all speed, since the Trojans have broken</p>
	<p id="IL.4.270">their oaths: a thing that shall be death and sorrow hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.4.271">to them, since they were the first to do violence over the oaths sworn.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.272">So he spoke, and Atreides, cheerful at heart, went onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.273">On his way through the thronging men he came to the Aiantes.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.274">These were armed, and about them went a cloud of foot-soldiers.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.275">As from his watching place a goatherd watches a cloud move</p>
	<p id="IL.4.276">on its way over the sea before the drive of the west wind;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.277">far away though he be he watches it, blacker than pitch is,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.278">moving across the sea and piling the storm before it,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.279">and as he sees it he shivers and drives his flocks to a cavern;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.280">so about the two Aiantes moved the battalions,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.281">close-compacted of strong and god-supported young fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.282">black, and jagged with spear and shield, to the terror of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.283">Agamemnon the lord of men was glad when he looked at them,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.284">and he spoke aloud to them and addressed them in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.285">'Aiantes, o leaders of the bronze-armoured Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.286">to you two I give no orders; it would not become me</p>
	<p id="IL.4.287">to speed you, now that yourselves drive your people on to fight strongly.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.288">Father Zeus, and Athene, and Apollo, if only</p>
	<p id="IL.4.289">such a spirit were in the hearts of all of my people.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.290">Then perhaps the city of lord Priam would be bent</p>
	<p id="IL.4.291">underneath our hands, captured and utterly taken.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.292">So he spoke, and left them there, and went among others.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.293">There he came upon Nestor, the lucid speaker of Pylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.294">setting in order his own companions and urging them to battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.295">tall Pelagon with those about him, Alastor and Chromios,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.296">Haimon the powerful, and Bias, shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.297">First he ranged the mounted men with their horses and chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.4.298">and stationed the brave and numerous foot-soldiers behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.299">to be the bastion of battle, and drove the cowards to the centre</p>
	<p id="IL.4.300">so that a man might be forced to fight even though unwilling.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.301">First he gave orders to the drivers of horses, and warned them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.302">to hold their horses in check and not be fouled in the multitude:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.303">'Let no man in the pride of his horsemanship and his manhood</p>
	<p id="IL.4.304">dare to fight alone with the Trojans in front of the rest of us,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.305">neither let him give ground, since that way you will be weaker.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.306">When a man from his own car encounters the enemy chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.4.307">let him stab with his spear, since this is the stronger fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.308">So the men before your time sacked tower and city,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.309">keeping a spirit like this in their hearts, and like this their purpose.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.310">Thus the old man wise in fighting from of old encouraged them.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.311">Agamemnon the lord of men was glad when he looked at him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.312">and he spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.313">'Aged sir, if only, as the spirit is in your bosom,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.314">so might your knees be also and the strength stay steady within you;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.315">but age weakens you which comes to all; if only some other</p>
	<p id="IL.4.316">of the fighters had your age and you were one of the young men!'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.317">Nestor the Gerenian horseman spoke and answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.318">'Son of Atreus, so would I also wish to be that</p>
	<p id="IL.4.319">man I was, when I cut down brilliant Ereuthalion.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.320">But the gods give to mortals not everything at the same time;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.321">if I was a young man then, now in turn old age is upon me.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.322">Yet even so I shall be among the riders, and command them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.323">with word and counsel; such is the privilege of the old men.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.324">The young spearmen shall do the spear-fighting, those who are born</p>
	<p id="IL.4.325">of a generation later than mine, who trust in their own strength.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.326">So he spoke, and Atreides, cheerful at heart, went onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.327">He came on the son of Peteos, Menestheus, driver of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.328">standing still, and about him the Athenians, urgent for battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.329">Next to these resourceful Odysseus had taken position,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.330">and beside him the Kephallenian ranks, no weak ones,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.331">were standing, since the men had not heard the clamour of battle</p>
	<p id="IL.4.332">but even now fresh set in motion moved the battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.4.333">of Achaians and Trojans, breakers of horses; so these standing</p>
	<p id="IL.4.334">waited, until some other mass of Achaians advancing</p>
	<p id="IL.4.335">might crash against the Trojans, and the battle be opened.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.336">Seeing these the lord of men Agamemnon scolded them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.337">and spoke aloud to them and addressed them in winged words, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.338">'Son of Peteos, the king supported of God: and you, too,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.339">you with your mind forever on profit and your ways of treachery,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.340">why do you stand here skulking aside, and wait for the others?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.341">For you two it is becoming to stand among the foremost</p>
	<p id="IL.4.342">fighters, and endure your share of the blaze of battle;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.343">since indeed you two are first to hear of the feasting</p>
	<p id="IL.4.344">whenever we Achaians make ready a feast of the princes.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.345">There it is your pleasure to eat the roast flesh, to drink</p>
	<p id="IL.4.346">as much as you please the cups of the wine that is sweet as honey.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.347">Now, though, you would be pleased to look on though ten battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.4.348">of Achaians were to fight with the pitiless bronze before you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.349">Then looking at him darkly resourceful Odysseus spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.350">'What is this word that broke through the fence of your teeth, Atreides?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.351">How can you say that, when we Achaians waken the bitter</p>
	<p id="IL.4.352">war god on Trojans, breakers of horses, I hang back from</p>
	<p id="IL.4.353">fighting? Only watch, if you care to and if it concerns you,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.354">the very father of Telemachos locked with the champion</p>
	<p id="IL.4.355">Trojans, breakers of horses. Your talk is wind, and no meaning.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.356">Powerful Agamemnon in turn answered him, laughing,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.357">seeing that he was angered and taking back the word spoken:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.358">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.359">I must not be niggling with you, nor yet give you orders,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.360">since I know how the spirit in your secret heart knows</p>
	<p id="IL.4.361">ideas of kindness only; for what you think is what I think.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.362">Come now, I will make it good hereafter, if anything evil</p>
	<p id="IL.4.363">has been said; let the gods make all this come to nothing.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.364">So he spoke, and left him there, and went among others.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.365">He came on the son of Tydeus, high-spirited Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.366">standing among the compacted chariots and by the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.367">and Kapaneus' son, Sthenelos, was standing beside him. At sight</p>
	<p id="IL.4.368">of Diomedes the lord of men Agamemnon scolded him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.369">and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.370">'Ah me, son of Tydeus, that daring breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.371">why are you skulking and spying out the outworks of battle?</p>
	<p id="IL.4.372">Such was never Tydeus' way, to lurk in the background,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.373">but to fight the enemy far ahead of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.374">So they say who had seen him at work, since I never saw nor</p>
	<p id="IL.4.375">encountered him ever; but they say he surpassed all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.376">Once on a time he came, but not in war, to Mykenai</p>
	<p id="IL.4.377">with godlike Polyneikes, a guest and a friend, assembling</p>
	<p id="IL.4.378">people, since these were attacking the sacred bastions of Thebe,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.379">and much they entreated us to grant him renowned companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.380">And our men wished to give them and were assenting to what they asked for</p>
	<p id="IL.4.381">but Zeus turned them back, showing forth portents that crossed them.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.382">Now as these went forward and were well on their way, and came</p>
	<p id="IL.4.383">to the river Asopos, and the meadows of grass and the deep rushes,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.384">from there the Achaians sent Tydeus ahead with a message.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.385">He went then and came on the Kadmeians in their numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.4.386">feasting all about the house of mighty Eteokles.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.387">There, stranger though he was, the driver of horses, Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.388">was not frightened, alone among so many Kadmeians,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.389">but dared them to try their strength with him, and bested all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.390">easily, such might did Pallas Athene give him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.391">The Kadmeians who lash their horses, in anger compacted</p>
	<p id="IL.4.392">an ambuscade of guile on his way home, assembling together</p>
	<p id="IL.4.393">fifty fighting men, and for these there were two leaders,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.394">Maion, Haimon's son, in the likeness of the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.395">with the son of Autophonos, Polyphontes stubborn in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.396">On these men Tydeus let loose a fate that was shameful.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.397">He killed them all, except that he let one man get home again,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.398">letting Maion go in obedience to the god's signs.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.399">This was Tydeus, the Aitolian; yet he was father</p>
	<p id="IL.4.400">to a son worse than himself at fighting, better in conclave.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.401">So he spoke, and strong Diomedes gave no answer</p>
	<p id="IL.4.402">in awe before the majesty of the king's rebuking;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.403">but the son of Kapaneus the glorious answered him, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.404">'Son of Atreus, do not lie when you know the plain truth.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.405">We two claim we are better men by far than our fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.406">We did storm the seven-gated foundation of Thebe</p>
	<p id="IL.4.407">though we led fewer people beneath a wall that was stronger.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.408">We obeyed the signs of the gods and the help Zeus gave us,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.409">while those others died of their own headlong stupidity.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.410">Therefore, never liken our fathers to us in honour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.411">Then looking at him darkly strong Diomedes spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.412">'Friend, stay quiet rather and do as I tell you; I will</p>
	<p id="IL.4.413">find no fault with Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.414">for stirring thus into battle the strong-greaved Achaians;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.415">this will be his glory to come, if ever the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.4.416">cut down the men of Troy and capture sacred Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.417">If the Achaians are slain, then his will be the great sorrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.418">Come, let you and me remember our fighting courage.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.419">He spoke and leapt in all his gear to the ground from the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.420">and the bronze armour girt to the chest of the king clashed terribly</p>
	<p id="IL.4.421">as he sprang. Fear would have gripped even a man stout-hearted.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.422">As when along the thundering beach the surf of the sea strikes</p>
	<p id="IL.4.423">beat upon beat as the west wind drives it onward; far out</p>
	<p id="IL.4.424">cresting first on the open water, it drives thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.4.425">to smash roaring along the dry land, and against the rock jut</p>
	<p id="IL.4.426">bending breaks itself into crests spewing back the salt wash;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.427">so thronged beat upon beat the Danaans' close battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.4.428">steadily into battle, with each of the lords commanding</p>
	<p id="IL.4.429">his own men; and these went silently, you would not think</p>
	<p id="IL.4.430">all these people with voices kept in their chests were marching;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.431">silently, in fear of their commanders; and upon all</p>
	<p id="IL.4.432">glittered as they marched the shining armour they carried.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.433">But the Trojans, as sheep in a man of possessions' steading</p>
	<p id="IL.4.434">stand in their myriads waiting to be drained of their white milk</p>
	<p id="IL.4.435">and bleat interminably as they hear the voice of their lambs, so</p>
	<p id="IL.4.436">the crying of the Trojans went up through the wide army.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.437">Since there was no speech nor language common to all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.4.438">but their talk was mixed, who were called there from many far places.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.439">Ares drove these on, and the Achaians grey-eyed Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.440">and Terror drove them, and Fear, and Hate whose wrath is relentless,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.441">she the sister and companion of murderous Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.442">she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.4.443">grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.444">She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.4.445">as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.446">Now as these advancing came to one place and encountered,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.447">they dashed their shields together and their spears, and the strength</p>
	<p id="IL.4.448">of armoured men in bronze, and the shields massive in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.4.449">clashed against each other, and the sound grew huge of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.450">There the screaming and the shouts of triumph rose up together</p>
	<p id="IL.4.451">of men killing and men killed, and the ground ran blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.452">As when rivers in winter spate running down from the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.4.453">throw together at the meeting of streams the weight of their water</p>
	<p id="IL.4.454">out of the great springs behind in the hollow stream-bed,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.455">and far away in the mountains the shepherd hears their thunder;</p>
	<p id="IL.4.456">such, from the coming together of men, was the shock and the shouting.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.457">Antilochos was first to kill a chief man of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.458">valiant among the champions, Thalysias' son, Echepolos.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.459">Throwing first, he struck the horn of the horse-haired helmet,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.460">and the bronze spearpoint fixed in his forehead and drove inward</p>
	<p id="IL.4.461">through the bone; and a mist of darkness clouded both eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.4.462">and he fell as a tower falls in the strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.463">As he dropped, Elephenor the powerful caught him by the feet,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.464">Chalkodon's son, and lord of the great-hearted Abantes,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.465">and dragged him away from under the missiles, striving in all speed</p>
	<p id="IL.4.466">to strip the armour from him, yet his outrush went short-lived.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.467">For as he hauled the corpse high-hearted Agenor, marking</p>
	<p id="IL.4.468">the ribs that showed bare under the shield as he bent over,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.469">stabbed with the bronze-pointed spear and unstrung his sinews.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.470">So the spirit left him and over his body was fought out</p>
	<p id="IL.4.471">weary work by Trojans and Achaians, who like wolves</p>
	<p id="IL.4.472">sprang upon one another, with man against man in the onfall.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.473">There Telamonian Aias struck down the son of Anthemion</p>
	<p id="IL.4.474">Simoeisios in his stripling's beauty, whom once his mother</p>
	<p id="IL.4.475">descending from Ida bore beside the banks of Simoeis</p>
	<p id="IL.4.476">when she had followed her father and mother to tend the sheepflocks.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.477">Therefore they called him Simoeisios; but he could not</p>
	<p id="IL.4.478">render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.479">beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.480">who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple</p>
	<p id="IL.4.481">of the right breast, and the bronze spearhead drove clean through the shoulder.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.482">He dropped then to the ground in the dust, like some black poplar,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.483">which in the land low-lying about a great marsh grows</p>
	<p id="IL.4.484">smooth trimmed yet with branches growing at the uttermost tree-top:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.485">one whom a man, a maker of chariots, fells with the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.4.486">iron, to bend it into a wheel for a fine-wrought chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.487">and the tree lies hardening by the banks of a river.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.488">Such was Anthemion's son Simoeisios, whom illustrious</p>
	<p id="IL.4.489">Aias killed. Now Antiphos of the shining corselet,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.490">Priam's son, made a cast at him in the crowd with the sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.4.491">but missed Aias and struck Leukos, a brave companion</p>
	<p id="IL.4.492">of Odysseus, in the groin, as he dragged a corpse off,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.493">so that the body dropped from his hand as he fell above it.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.494">For his killing Odysseus was stirred to terrible anger</p>
	<p id="IL.4.495">and he strode out among the champions, helmed in bright bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.496">and stood close to the enemy hefting the shining javelin,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.497">glaring round about him; and the Trojans gave way in the face</p>
	<p id="IL.4.498">of the man throwing with the spear. And he made no vain cast,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.499">but struck down Demokoön, a son of Priam, a bastard,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.500">who came over from Abydos, and left his fast-running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.501">Odysseus struck him with the spear, in anger for his companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.502">in the temple, and the bronze spearhead drove through the other</p>
	<p id="IL.4.503">temple also, so that a mist of darkness clouded both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.504">He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.505">The champions of Troy gave back then, and glorious Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.506">and the Argives gave a great cry, and dragged back the bodies,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.507">and drove their way far forward, but now Apollo watching</p>
	<p id="IL.4.508">from high Pergamos was angered, and called aloud to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.4.509">'Rise up, Trojans, breakers of horses, bend not from battle</p>
	<p id="IL.4.510">with these Argives. Surely their skin is not stone, not iron</p>
	<p id="IL.4.511">to stand up under the tearing edge of the bronze as it strikes them.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.512">No, nor is Achilleus the child of lovely-haired Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.4.513">fighting, but beside the ship mulls his heartsore anger.'</p>
	<p id="IL.4.514">So called the fearful god from the citadel, while Zeus' daughter</p>
	<p id="IL.4.515">Tritogeneia, goddess most high, drove on the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.516">any of them she saw hanging back as she strode through the battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.517">Now his doom caught fast Amaryngkeus' son Diores,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.518">who with a jagged boulder was smitten beside the ankle</p>
	<p id="IL.4.519">in the right shin, and a lord of the Thracian warriors threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.520">Peiros, son of Imbrasos, who had journeyed from Ainos.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.521">The pitiless stone smashed utterly the tendons on both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.4.522">with the bones, and he was hurled into the dust backwards</p>
	<p id="IL.4.523">reaching out both hands to his own beloved companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.524">gasping life out; the stone's thrower ran up beside him,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.525">Peiros, and stabbed with his spear next the navel, and all his guts poured</p>
	<p id="IL.4.526">out on the ground, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.527">Thoas the Aitolian hit Peiros as he ran backward</p>
	<p id="IL.4.528">with the spear in the chest above the nipple, and the bronze point fixed</p>
	<p id="IL.4.529">in the lung, and Thoas standing close dragged out the heavy</p>
	<p id="IL.4.530">spear from his chest, and drawing his sharp sword struck him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.531">in the middle of the belly, and so took the life from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.532">yet did not strip his armour, for his companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.4.533">stood, Thracians with hair grown at the top, gripping their long spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.534">and though he was a mighty man and a strong and proud one</p>
	<p id="IL.4.535">thrust him from them so that he gave ground backward, staggering.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.536">So in the dust these two lay sprawled beside one another,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.537">lords, the one of the Thracians, the other of the bronze-armoured</p>
	<p id="IL.4.538">Epeians; and many others beside were killed all about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.539">There no more could a man who was in that work make light of it,</p>
	<p id="IL.4.540">one who still unhit and still unstabbed by the sharp bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.4.541">spun in the midst of that fighting, with Pallas Athene's hold on</p>
	<p id="IL.4.542">his hand guiding him, driving back the volleying spears thrown.</p>
	<p id="IL.4.543">For on that day many men of the Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.4.544">lay sprawled in the dust face downward beside one another.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.1">THERE to Tydeus' son Diomedes Pallas Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.5.2">granted strength and daring, that he might be conspicuous</p>
	<p id="IL.5.3">among all the Argives and win the glory of valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.4">She made weariless fire blaze from his shield and helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.5.5">like that star of the waning summer who beyond all stars</p>
	<p id="IL.5.6">rises bathed in the ocean stream to glitter in brilliance.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.7">Such was the fire she made blaze from his head and his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.5.8">and urged him into the middle fighting, where most were struggling.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.9">There was a man of the Trojans, Dares, blameless and bountiful,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.10">priest consecrated to Hephaistos, and he had two sons,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.11">Phegeus and Idaios, well skilled both in all fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.12">These two breaking from the ranks of the others charged against him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.13">riding their chariot as Diomedes came on, dismounted.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.14">Now as in their advance these had come close to each other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.15">first of the two Phegeus let go his spear far-shadowing.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.16">Over the left shoulder of Tydeus' son passed the pointed</p>
	<p id="IL.5.17">spear, nor struck his body, and Diomedes thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.5.18">threw with the bronze, and the weapon cast from his hand flew not vain</p>
	<p id="IL.5.19">but struck the chest between the nipples and hurled him from behind</p>
	<p id="IL.5.20">his horses. And Idaios leaping left the fair-wrought chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.21">nor had he the courage to stand over his stricken brother.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.22">Even so he could not have escaped the black death-spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.5.23">but Hephaistos caught him away and rescued him, shrouded in darkness,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.24">that the aged man might not be left altogether desolate.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.25">But the son of high-hearted Tydeus drove off the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.26">and gave them to his company to lead back to the hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.27">Now as the high-hearted Trojans watched the two sons of Dares,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.28">one running away, and one cut down by the side of his chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.29">the anger in all of them was stirred. But grey-eyed Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.5.30">took violent Ares by the hand, and in words she spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.31">'Ares, Ares, manslaughtering, blood-stained, stormer of strong walls,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.32">shall we not leave the Trojans and Achaians to struggle</p>
	<p id="IL.5.33">after whatever way Zeus father grants glory to either,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.34">while we two give ground together and avoid Zeus' anger?'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.35">So she spoke, and led violent Ares out of the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.36">and afterwards caused him to sit down by the sands of Skamandros</p>
	<p id="IL.5.37">while the Danaans bent the Trojans back, and each of the princes</p>
	<p id="IL.5.38">killed his man. And first the lord of men Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.39">hurled tall Odios, lord of the Halizones, from his chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.40">For in his back even as he was turning the spear fixed</p>
	<p id="IL.5.41">between the shoulders and was driven on through the chest beyond it.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.42">He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.43">Idomeneus killed Phaistos the son of Maionian Boros,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.44">who had come out of Tarne with the deep soil. Idomeneus</p>
	<p id="IL.5.45">the spear-renowned stabbed this man just as he was mounting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.46">behind his horses, with the long spear driven in the right shoulder.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.47">He dropped from the chariot, and the hateful darkness took hold of him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.48">The henchmen of Idomeneus stripped the armour from Phaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.49">while Menelaos son of Atreus killed with the sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.50">Strophios' son, a man of wisdom in the chase, Skamandrios,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.51">the fine huntsman of beasts. Artemis herself had taught him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.52">to strike down every wild thing that grows in the mountain forest.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.53">Yet Artemis of the showering arrows could not now help him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.54">no, nor the long spearcasts in which he had been pre-eminent,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.55">but Menelaos the spear-famed, son of Atreus, stabbed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.56">as he fled away before him, in the back with a spear thrust</p>
	<p id="IL.5.57">between the shoulders and driven through to the chest beyond it.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.58">He dropped forward on his face and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.59">Meriones in turn killed Phereklos, son of Harmonides,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.60">the smith, who understood how to make with his hand all intricate</p>
	<p id="IL.5.61">things, since above all others Pallas Athene had loved him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.62">He it was who had built for Alexandros the balanced</p>
	<p id="IL.5.63">ships, the beginning of the evil, fatal to the other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.64">Trojans, and to him, since he knew nothing of the gods' plans.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.65">This man Meriones pursued and overtaking him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.66">struck in the right buttock, and the spearhead drove straight</p>
	<p id="IL.5.67">on and passing under the bone went into the bladder.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.68">He dropped, screaming, to his knees, and death was a mist about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.69">Meges in turn killed Pedaios, the son of Antenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.70">who, bastard though he was, was nursed by lovely Theano</p>
	<p id="IL.5.71">with close care, as for her own children, to pleasure her husband.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.72">Now the son of Phyleus, the spear-famed, closing upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.73">struck him with the sharp spear behind the head at the tendon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.74">and straight on through the teeth and under the tongue cut the bronze blade,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.75">and he dropped in the dust gripping in his teeth the cold bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.76">Eurypylos, Euaimon's son, killed brilliant Hypsenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.77">son of high-hearted Dolopion, he who was made Skamandros'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.78">priest, and was honoured about the countryside as a god is.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.79">This man Eurypylos, the shining son of Euaimon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.80">running in chase as he fled before him struck in the shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.5.81">with a blow swept from the sword and cut the arm's weight from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.82">so that the arm dropped bleeding to the ground, and the red death</p>
	<p id="IL.5.83">and destiny the powerful took hold of both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.84">So they went at their work all about the strong encounter;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.85">but you could not have told on which side Tydeus' son was fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.86">whether he were one with the Trojans or with the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.87">since he went storming up the plain like a winter-swollen</p>
	<p id="IL.5.88">river in spate that scatters the dikes in its running current,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.89">one that the strong-compacted dikes can contain no longer,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.90">neither the mounded banks of the blossoming vineyards hold it</p>
	<p id="IL.5.91">rising suddenly as Zeus' rain makes heavy the water</p>
	<p id="IL.5.92">and many lovely works of the young men crumble beneath it.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.93">Like these the massed battalions of the Trojans were scattered</p>
	<p id="IL.5.94">by Tydeus' son, and many as they were could not stand against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.95">Now as the shining son of Lykaon, Pandaros, watched him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.96">storming up the plain scattering the battalions before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.97">at once he strained the bent bow against the son of Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.98">and shot, and hit him as he charged forward, in the right shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.5.99">at the hollow of the corselet; and the bitter arrow went straight through</p>
	<p id="IL.5.100">holding clean to its way, and the corselet was all blood-spattered.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.101">And the shining son of Lykaon cried aloud in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.102">'Rise up, Trojans, o high-hearted, lashers of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.103">Now the best of the Achaians is hit, and I think that he will not</p>
	<p id="IL.5.104">long hold up under the strong arrow, if truly Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.5.105">lord and son of Zeus stirred me to come forth from Lykia.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.106">So he spoke, vaunting, but the swift arrow had not broken him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.107">only he drew back again to his chariot and horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.108">and stood there, speaking to Sthenelos, son of Kapaneus:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.109">'Come, dear friend, son of Kapaneus, step down from the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.110">so that you may pull out from my shoulder this bitter arrow.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.111">So he spoke, and Sthenelos sprang to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.112">and standing beside him pulled the sharp arrow clean through his shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.5.113">and the blood shot up spurting through the delicate tunic.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.114">Now Diomedes of the great war cry spoke aloud, praying:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.115">'Hear me now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.116">if ever before in kindliness you stood by my father</p>
	<p id="IL.5.117">through the terror of fighting, be my friend now also, Athene;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.118">grant me that I may kill this man and come within spearcast,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.119">who shot me before I could see him, and now boasts over me, saying</p>
	<p id="IL.5.120">I cannot live to look much longer on the shining sunlight.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.121">So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.122">She made his limbs light again, and his feet, and his hands above them,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.123">and standing close beside him she spoke and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.124">'Be of good courage now, Diomedes, to fight with the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.125">since I have put inside your chest the strength of your father</p>
	<p id="IL.5.126">untremulous, such as the horseman Tydeus of the great shield</p>
	<p id="IL.5.127">had; I have taken away the mist from your eyes, that before now</p>
	<p id="IL.5.128">was there, so that you may well recognize the god and the mortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.129">Therefore now, if a god making trial of you comes hither</p>
	<p id="IL.5.130">do you not do battle head on with the gods immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.131">not with the rest; but only if Aphrodite, Zeus' daughter,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.132">comes to the fighting, her at least you may stab with the sharp bronze.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.133">She spoke thus, grey-eyed Athene, and went, while Tydeus'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.134">son closed once again with the champions, taking his place there;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.135">raging as he had been before to fight with the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.136">now the strong rage tripled took hold of him, as of a lion</p>
	<p id="IL.5.137">whom the shepherd among his fleecy flocks in the wild lands</p>
	<p id="IL.5.138">grazed as he leapt the fence of the fold, but has not killed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.139">but only stirred up the lion's strength, and can no more fight him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.140">off, but hides in the steading, and the frightened sheep are forsaken,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.141">and these are piled pell-mell on each other in heaps, while the lion</p>
	<p id="IL.5.142">raging still leaps out again over the fence of the deep yard;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.143">such was the rage of strong Diomedes as he closed with the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.144">Next he killed Astynoös and Hypeiron, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.145">striking one with the bronze-heeled spear above the nipple,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.146">and cutting the other beside the shoulder through the collar-bone</p>
	<p id="IL.5.147">with the great sword, so that neck and back were hewn free of the shoulder.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.148">He left these men, and went on after Polyidos and Abas,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.149">sons of the aged dream-interpreter, Eurydamas;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.150">yet for these two as they went forth the old man did not answer</p>
	<p id="IL.5.151">their dreams, but Diomedes the powerful slew them. Now he</p>
	<p id="IL.5.152">went after the two sons of Phainops, Xanthos and Thoön,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.153">full grown both, but Phainops was stricken in sorrowful old age</p>
	<p id="IL.5.154">nor could breed another son to leave among his possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.155">There he killed these two and took away the dear life from them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.156">both, leaving to their father lamentation and sorrowful</p>
	<p id="IL.5.157">affliction, since he was not to welcome them home from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.158">alive still; and remoter kinsmen shared his possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.159">Next he killed two children of Dardanian Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.5.160">who were in a single chariot, Echemmon and Chromios.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.161">As among cattle a lion leaps on the neck of an ox or</p>
	<p id="IL.5.162">heifer, that grazes among the wooded places, and breaks it,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.163">so the son of Tydeus hurled both from their horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.164">hatefully, in spite of their struggles, then stripped their armour</p>
	<p id="IL.5.165">and gave the horses to his company to drive to their vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.166">Now as Aineias saw him wrecking the ranks of warriors</p>
	<p id="IL.5.167">he went on his way through the fighting and the spears' confusion</p>
	<p id="IL.5.168">looking to see if he could find Pandaros the godlike;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.169">and he came upon the strong and blameless son of Lykaon.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.170">He stood before him face to face and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.171">'Pandaros, where now are your bow and your feathered arrows;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.172">where your fame, in which no man here dare contend with you</p>
	<p id="IL.5.173">nor can any man in Lykia claim he is better?</p>
	<p id="IL.5.174">Come then, hold up your hands to Zeus, and let go an arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.5.175">at this strong man, whoever he be, who does so much evil</p>
	<p id="IL.5.176">to the Trojans, since many and great are those whose knees he has broken.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.177">Unless this be some god who in wrath with the Trojans for offerings</p>
	<p id="IL.5.178">failed afflicts them. The wrath of a god is hard to deal with.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.179">Then in answer the shining son of Lykaon spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.180">'Aineias, charged with the counsels of the bronze-armoured Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.181">I liken him in all ways to the valiant son of Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.182">going by his shield and the hollow eyes of his helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.5.183">and by the look of his horses; but it may be a god, I am not sure;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.184">and if this is a man, as I think, and the valiant son</p>
	<p id="IL.5.185">of Tydeus, yet not without god does he rage so, but some one</p>
	<p id="IL.5.186">of the immortals, mantling in mist his shoulders, stands close beside him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.187">who turned my flying arrow as it struck, elsewhere, away from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.188">For I have shot my shaft already, and hit him in the shoulder,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.189">the right one, hard driven through the hollow of his corselet,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.190">and I said to myself I had hurled him down to meet Aidoneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.191">yet still I have not beaten him; now this is some god who is angered.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.192">But I have no horses nor chariot I could mount in, and yet</p>
	<p id="IL.5.193">somewhere in the great house of Lykaon are eleven chariots,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.194">beauties, all new made, just finished, and over them blankets</p>
	<p id="IL.5.195">lie spread, and beside each chariot one brace of horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.196">stand there, champing their white barley and oats. But Lykaon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.197">the aged spearman spoke to me over and over, as I was</p>
	<p id="IL.5.198">on my way from the house well compacted, advising me;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.199">he told me to take my horses and chariots, and riding</p>
	<p id="IL.5.200">there to be lord among the Trojans in the strong encounters.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.201">I did not let him persuade me, and that would have been far better,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.202">sparing my horses, who had grown accustomed to eating all</p>
	<p id="IL.5.203">they wished, from going hungry where the men were penned in a small place.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.204">So I left them and made my way on foot to Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.5.205">trusting my bow, a thing that was to profit me nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.206">For now I have drawn it against two of their best men, Tydeus'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.207">son, and the son of Atreus, and both of these I hit</p>
	<p id="IL.5.208">and drew visible blood, yet only wakened their anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.209">So it was in bad luck that I took from its peg the curved bow</p>
	<p id="IL.5.210">on that day when I carried it to lovely Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.5.211">at the head of my Trojans, bringing delight to brilliant Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.212">Now if ever I win home again and lay eyes once more</p>
	<p id="IL.5.213">on my country, and my wife, and the great house with the high roof,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.214">let some stranger straightway cut my head from my shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.5.215">if I do not break this bow in my hands and throw it in the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.5.216">fire, since as a wind and nothing I have taken it with me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.217">Then in turn Aineias, lord of the Trojans, answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.218">'Speak no more this way; there will be no time for changing</p>
	<p id="IL.5.219">before you and I must face this man with horses and chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.220">and strength against strength fight it out with our weapons. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.5.221">mount rather into my chariot, so that you may see</p>
	<p id="IL.5.222">what the Trojan horses are like, how they understand their</p>
	<p id="IL.5.223">plain, and how to traverse it in rapid pursuit and withdrawal.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.224">These two will bring us safe to the city again, if once more</p>
	<p id="IL.5.225">Zeus grants glory to Diomedes the son of Tydeus.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.226">Come then, taking into your hands the goad and the glittering</p>
	<p id="IL.5.227">reins, while I dismount from my chariot and carry the fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.228">or else yourself encounter this man, while I handle the horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.229">Then in answer the shining son of Lykaon spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.230">'Keep yourself, Aineias, the reins and your horses. These will</p>
	<p id="IL.5.231">carry better the curved chariot under the driver</p>
	<p id="IL.5.232">they know best, if we must give way before the son of Tydeus;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.233">for fear they might go wild with terror and not be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.5.234">to carry us out of the fighting, as they listen and long for your voice,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.235">for fear the son of high-hearted Tydeus charging upon us</p>
	<p id="IL.5.236">might kill us both and drive away the single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.237">Rather drive yourself your own horses and your own chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.238">while with my sharp spear I encounter this man as he comes on.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.239">They spoke so, and mounting the wrought chariot held</p>
	<p id="IL.5.240">their fast-running horses against the son of Tydeus, in fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.241">And Sthenelos the shining son of Kapaneus seeing them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.242">swiftly uttered his winged words to the son of Tydeus:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.243">'Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.244">look, I see two mighty men furious to fight with you.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.245">Their strength is enormous, one of them well skilled in the bow's work,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.246">Pandaros, who claims his right as son of Lykaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.247">and the other Aineias, who claims he was born as son to</p>
	<p id="IL.5.248">Anchises the blameless, but his mother was Aphrodite.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.249">Come then, let us give way with our horses; no longer storm on</p>
	<p id="IL.5.250">so far among the champions, for fear you destroy your heart's life.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.251">Then looking at him darkly strong Diomedes spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.252">'Argue me not toward flight, since I have no thought of obeying you.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.253">No, for it would be ignoble for me to shrink back in the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.254">or to lurk aside, since my fighting strength stays steady forever.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.255">I shrink indeed from mounting behind the horses, but as I am</p>
	<p id="IL.5.256">now, I will face these. Pallas Athene will not let me run from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.257">These two men, their fast-running horses shall never carry them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.258">both back away from us, even though one man may escape us.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.259">And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.260">If Athene of the many counsels should grant me the glory</p>
	<p id="IL.5.261">to kill both, then do you check here these fast-running horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.262">ours, tethering them with the reins tied to the chariot's rail and thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.5.263">remember to make a dash against the horses of Aineias,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.264">and drive them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.265">These are of that strain which Zeus of the wide brows granted</p>
	<p id="IL.5.266">once to Tros, recompense for his son Ganymedes, and therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.5.267">are the finest of all horses beneath the sun and the daybreak;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.268">and the lord of men Anchises stole horses from this breed,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.269">without the knowledge of Laomedon putting mares under them.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.270">From these there was bred for him a string of six in his great house.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.271">Four of these, keeping them himself, he raised at his mangers,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.272">but these two he gave to Aineias, two horses urgent of terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.273">If we might only take these we should win ourselves excellent glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.274">Now as these were speaking things like this to each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.275">the two came fast upon them driving their swift-running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.276">First to Diomedes called out the shining son of Lykaon:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.277">'Valiant and strong-spirited, o son of proud Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.278">you were not beaten then by the bitter arrow, my swift shot.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.279">Now I will try with the throwing-spear to see if I can hit you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.280">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.281">and struck the son of Tydeus in the shield, and the flying</p>
	<p id="IL.5.282">bronze spearhead was driven clean through and into the corselet,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.283">and the shining son of Lykaon cried aloud in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.284">'Now are you struck clean through the middle, and I think that you will not</p>
	<p id="IL.5.285">hold up for much longer; you have given me great claim to glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.286">Then strong Diomedes answered, not frightened before him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.287">'You did not hit me, you missed, but I do not think that you two</p>
	<p id="IL.5.288">will go free until one or the other of you has fallen</p>
	<p id="IL.5.289">to glut with his blood Ares the god who fights under the shield's guard.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.290">He spoke, and threw; and Pallas Athene guided the weapon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.291">to the nose next to the eye, and it cut on through the white teeth</p>
	<p id="IL.5.292">and the bronze weariless shore all the way through the tongue's base</p>
	<p id="IL.5.293">so that the spearhead came out underneath the jawbone.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.294">He dropped then from the chariot and his armour clattered upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.295">dazzling armour and shining, while those fast-running horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.296">shied away, and there his life and his strength were scattered.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.297">But Aineias sprang to the ground with shield and with long spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.298">for fear that somehow the Achaians might haul off the body,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.299">and like a lion in the pride of his strength stood over him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.300">holding before him the perfect circle of his shield and the spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.301">and raging to cut down any man who might come to face him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.302">crying a terrible cry. But Tydeus' son in his hand caught</p>
	<p id="IL.5.303">up a stone, a huge thing which no two men could carry</p>
	<p id="IL.5.304">such as men are now, but by himself he lightly hefted it.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.305">He threw, and caught Aineias in the hip, in the place where the hip-bone</p>
	<p id="IL.5.306">turns inside the thigh, the place men call the cup-socket.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.307">It smashed the cup-socket and broke the tendons both sides of it,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.308">and the rugged stone tore the skin backward, so that the fighter</p>
	<p id="IL.5.309">dropping to one knee stayed leaning on the ground with his heavy</p>
	<p id="IL.5.310">hand, and a covering of black night came over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.311">Now in this place Aineias lord of men might have perished</p>
	<p id="IL.5.312">had not Aphrodite, Zeus' daughter, been quick to perceive him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.313">his mother, who had borne him to Anchises the ox-herd;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.314">and about her beloved son came streaming her white arms,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.315">and with her white robe thrown in a fold in front she shielded him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.316">this keeping off the thrown weapons lest some fast-mounted Danaan</p>
	<p id="IL.5.317">strike the bronze spear through his chest and strip the life from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.318">She then carried her beloved son out of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.319">Nor did Sthenelos son of Kapaneus forget the commandments</p>
	<p id="IL.5.320">that Diomedes of the great war cry had laid upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.321">but he held where they were their own single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.322">with their reins tied to the chariot rail, apart from the confusion,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.323">and making a dash for the fluttering-maned horses of Aineias</p>
	<p id="IL.5.324">drove them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.325">and gave them to Deïpylos, his close friend, whom beyond all</p>
	<p id="IL.5.326">others of his own age he prized, for their hearts were intimate,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.327">to drive away to the hollow ships; meanwhile the warrior</p>
	<p id="IL.5.328">mounted behind his own horses and caught up the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.5.329">reins, and held the strong-footed team toward the son of Tydeus</p>
	<p id="IL.5.330">headlong; and he swung the pitiless bronze at the lady of Kypros,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.331">knowing her for a god without warcraft, not of those who,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.332">goddesses, range in order the ranks of men in the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.333">not Athene and not Enyo, sacker of cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.334">Now as, following her through the thick crowd, he caught her,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.335">lunging in his charge far forward the son of high-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.5.336">Tydeus made a thrust against the soft hand with the bronze spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.337">and the spear tore the skin driven clean on through the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.5.338">robe that the very Graces had woven for her carefully,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.339">over the palm's base; and blood immortal flowed from the goddess,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.340">ichor, that which runs in the veins of the blessed divinities;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.341">since these eat no food, nor do they drink of the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.5.342">wine, and therefore they have no blood and are called immortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.343">She gave a great shriek and let fall her son she was carrying,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.344">but Phoibos Apollo caught him up and away in his own hands,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.345">in a dark mist, for fear that some fast-mounted Danaan</p>
	<p id="IL.5.346">might strike the bronze spear through his chest and strip the life from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.347">But Diomedes of the great war cry shouted after her:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.348">'Give way, daughter of Zeus, from the fighting and the terror. It is</p>
	<p id="IL.5.349">not then enough that you lead astray women without warcraft?</p>
	<p id="IL.5.350">Yet, if still you must haunt the fighting, I think that now you</p>
	<p id="IL.5.351">will shiver even when you hear some other talking of battles.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.352">So he spoke, and the goddess departed in pain, hurt badly,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.353">and Iris wind-footed took her by the hand and led her away</p>
	<p id="IL.5.354">from the battle, her lovely skin blood-darkened, wounded and suffering.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.355">There to the left of the fighting she found Ares the violent</p>
	<p id="IL.5.356">sitting, his spear leaned into the mist, and his swift horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.357">Dropping on one knee before her beloved brother</p>
	<p id="IL.5.358">in deep supplication she asked for his gold-bridled horses:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.359">'Beloved brother, rescue me and give me your horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.360">so I may come to Olympos where is the place of the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.361">I am in too much pain from the wound of a mortal's spear-stroke,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.362">Tydeus' son's, who would fight now even against Zeus father.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.363">So she spoke, and Ares gave her the gold-bridled horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.364">and, still grieved in the inward heart, she mounted the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.365">and beside her entering Iris gathered the reins up</p>
	<p id="IL.5.366">and whipped them into a run, and they winged their way unreluctant.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.367">Now as they came to sheer Olympos, the place of the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.368">there swift Iris the wind-footed reined in her horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.369">and slipped them from the yoke and threw fodder immortal before them,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.370">and now bright Aphrodite fell at the knees of her mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.371">Dione, who gathered her daughter into the arms' fold</p>
	<p id="IL.5.372">and stroked her with her hand and called her by name and spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.373">'Who now of the Uranian gods, dear child, has done such</p>
	<p id="IL.5.374">things to you, rashly, as if you were caught doing something wicked?'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.375">Aphrodite the sweetly laughing spoke then and answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.376">'Tydeus' son Diomedes, the too high-hearted, stabbed me</p>
	<p id="IL.5.377">as I was carrying my own beloved son out of the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.378">Aineias, who beyond all else in the world is dear to me;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.379">so now this is no horrible war of Achaians and Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.380">but the Danaans are beginning to fight even with the immortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.381">Then Dione the shining among divinities answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.382">'Have patience, my child, and endure it, though you be saddened.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.383">For many of us who have our homes on Olympos endure things</p>
	<p id="IL.5.384">from men, when ourselves we inflict hard pain on each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.385">Ares had to endure it when strong Ephialtes and Otos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.386">sons of Aloeus, chained him in bonds that were too strong for him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.387">and three months and ten he lay chained in the brazen cauldron;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.388">and now might Ares, insatiable of fighting, have perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.389">had not Eëriboia, their stepmother, the surpassingly lovely,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.390">brought word to Hermes, who stole Ares away out of it</p>
	<p id="IL.5.391">as he was growing faint and the hard bondage was breaking him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.392">Hera had to endure it when the strong son of Amphitryon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.393">struck her beside the right breast with a tri-barbed arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.394">so that the pain he gave her could not be quieted. Hades</p>
	<p id="IL.5.395">the gigantic had to endure with the rest the flying arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.5.396">when this self-same man, the son of Zeus of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.397">struck him among the dead men at Pylos, and gave him to agony;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.398">but he went up to the house of Zeus and to tall Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.5.399">heavy at heart, stabbed through and through with pain, for the arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.5.400">was driven into his heavy shoulder, and his spirit was suffering.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.401">But Paiëon, scattering medicines that still pain,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.402">healed him, since he was not made to be one of the mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.403">Brute, heavy-handed, who thought nothing of the bad he was doing,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.404">who with his archery hurt the gods that dwell on Olympos!</p>
	<p id="IL.5.405">It was the goddess grey-eyed Athene who drove on this man</p>
	<p id="IL.5.406">against you; poor fool, the heart of Tydeus' son knows nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.5.407">of how that man who fights the immortals lives for no long time,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.408">his children do not gather to his knees to welcome their father</p>
	<p id="IL.5.409">when he returns home after the fighting and the bitter warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.410">Then, though he be very strong indeed, let the son of Tydeus</p>
	<p id="IL.5.411">take care lest someone even better than he might fight with him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.412">lest for a long time Aigialeia, wise child of Adrastos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.413">mourning wake out of sleep her household's beloved companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.414">longing for the best of the Achaians, her lord by marriage,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.415">she, the strong wife of Diomedes, breaker of horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.416">She spoke, and with both hands stroked away from her arm the ichor,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.417">so that the arm was made whole again and the strong pains rested.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.418">But Hera and Athene glancing aside at her began</p>
	<p id="IL.5.419">to tease the son of Kronos, Zeus, in words of mockery:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.420">and the goddess grey-eyed Athene began the talk among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.421">'Father Zeus, would you be angry with me if I said</p>
	<p id="IL.5.422">something? It must be the lady of Kypros, moving some woman</p>
	<p id="IL.5.423">of Achaia to follow after those Trojans she loves so hopelessly,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.424">laying hold on the fair dresses of the Achaian women,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.425">tore the tenderness of her hand on a golden pin's point.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.426">So she spoke, and the father of gods and men smiled on her</p>
	<p id="IL.5.427">and spoke to Aphrodite the golden, calling her to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.428">'No, my child, not for you are the works of warfare. Rather</p>
	<p id="IL.5.429">concern yourself only with the lovely secrets of marriage,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.430">while all this shall be left to Athene and sudden Ares.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.431">Now as these were talking in this way with each other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.432">Diomedes of the great war cry made for Aineias.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.433">Though he saw how Apollo himself held his hands over him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.434">he did not shrink even from the great god, but forever forward</p>
	<p id="IL.5.435">drove, to kill Aineias and strip his glorious armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.436">Three times, furious to cut him down, he drove forward,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.437">and three times Apollo battered aside the bright shield,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.438">but as a fourth time, like more than man, he charged, Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.5.439">who strikes from afar cried out to him in the voice of terror:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.440">'Take care, give back, son of Tydeus, and strive no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.5.441">to make yourself like the gods in mind, since never the same is</p>
	<p id="IL.5.442">the breed of gods, who are immortal, and men who walk groundling.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.443">He spoke, and Tydeus' son gave backward, only a little,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.444">avoiding the anger of him who strikes from afar, Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.445">who caught Aineias now away from the onslaught, and set him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.446">in the sacred keep of Pergamos where was built his own temple.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.447">There Artemis of the showering arrows and Leto within</p>
	<p id="IL.5.448">the great and secret chamber healed his wound and cared for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.449">But he of the silver bow, Appollo, fashioned an image</p>
	<p id="IL.5.450">in the likeness of Aineias himself and in armour like him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.451">and all about this image brilliant Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.5.452">hewed at each other, and at the ox-hide shields strong circled</p>
	<p id="IL.5.453">guarding men's chests, and at the fluttering straps of the guard-skins.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.454">But Phoibos Apollo spoke now to violent Ares:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.455">'Ares, Ares, manslaughtering, blood-stained, stormer of strong walls,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.456">is there no way you can go and hold back this man from the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.457">Tydeus' son, who would now do battle against Zeus father?</p>
	<p id="IL.5.458">Even now he stabbed in her hand by the wrist the lady</p>
	<p id="IL.5.459">of Kypros, and again, like more than a man, charged even against me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.460">So he spoke, and himself alighted on the peak of Pergamos</p>
	<p id="IL.5.461">while stark Ares went down to stir the ranks of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.462">in the likeness of the lord of the Thracians, swift-footed Akamas,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.463">and urged onward the god-supported children of Priam:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.464">'O you children of Priam, the king whom the gods love, how long</p>
	<p id="IL.5.465">will you allow the Achaians to go on killing your people?</p>
	<p id="IL.5.466">Until they fight beside the strong-builded gates? A man lies</p>
	<p id="IL.5.467">fallen whom we honoured as we honour Hektor the brilliant,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.468">Aineias, who is son of great-hearted Anchises.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.469">Come then, let us rescue our good companion from the carnage.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.470">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and the strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.471">Then Sarpedon spoke in abuse to brilliant Hektor:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.472">'Where now, Hektor, has gone that strength that was yours? You said once</p>
	<p id="IL.5.473">that without companions and without people you could hold this city</p>
	<p id="IL.5.474">alone, with only your brothers and the lords of your sisters.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.475">I can see not one of these men now, I know not where they are;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.476">no, but they slink away like hounds who circle the lion,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.477">while we, who are here as your companions, carry the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.478">I have come, a companion to help you, from a very far place;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.479">Lykia lies far away, by the whirling waters of Xanthos;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.480">there I left behind my own wife and my baby son, there</p>
	<p id="IL.5.481">I left my many possessions which the needy man eyes longingly.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.482">Yet even so I drive on my Lykians, and myself have courage</p>
	<p id="IL.5.483">to fight my man in battle, though there is nothing of mine here</p>
	<p id="IL.5.484">that the Achaians can carry away as spoil or drive off.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.485">But you: you stand here, not even giving the word to the rest</p>
	<p id="IL.5.486">of your people to stand fast and fight in defence of their own wives.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.487">Let not yourselves, caught as in the sweeping toils of the spun net,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.488">be taken as war-spoil and plunder by the men who hate you,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.489">men who presently will storm your strong-founded citadel.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.490">All these things should lie night and day on your mind, forever,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.491">supplication to the lords of your far-renowned companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.492">to fight unwearying and hold off the strength of an insult.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.493">Sarpedon spoke, and his word bit into the heart of Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.494">Straightway in all his armour he sprang to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.495">and shaking two sharp spears ranged everywhere through the army</p>
	<p id="IL.5.496">stirring men up to fight and waking the hateful warfare;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.497">and these pulled themselves about and stood to face the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.498">while the Argives held in their close order and would not be broken.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.499">As when along the hallowed threshing floors the wind scatters</p>
	<p id="IL.5.500">chaff, among men winnowing, and fair-haired Demeter</p>
	<p id="IL.5.501">in the leaning wind discriminates the chaff and the true grain</p>
	<p id="IL.5.502">and the piling chaff whitens beneath it, so now the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.5.503">turned white underneath the dust the feet of the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.504">drove far into the brazen sky across their faces</p>
	<p id="IL.5.505">as they rapidly closed and the charioteers wheeled back again.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.506">They drove the strength of their hands straight on, as violent Ares</p>
	<p id="IL.5.507">defending the Trojans mantled in dark night the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.5.508">and passed everywhere, since he was carrying out the commandments</p>
	<p id="IL.5.509">of Phoibos Apollo, him of the golden sword, who had bidden him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.510">wake the heart in the Trojans as he saw that Pallas Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.5.511">was gone away now, she who stood to defend the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.512">And out of the rich secret chamber Apollo sent forth</p>
	<p id="IL.5.513">Aineias, and dropped strength in the heart of the people's shepherd.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.514">So Aineias stood among his friends, who were happy</p>
	<p id="IL.5.515">as they saw him coming back, still alive, and unwounded</p>
	<p id="IL.5.516">and full of brave spirit; yet they asked him no question,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.517">for the rest of their fighting work would not let them, that the silver-bow god</p>
	<p id="IL.5.518">woke, and manslaughtering Ares, and Hate, whose wrath is relentless.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.519">Now the two Aiantes and Odysseus and Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.5.520">stirred the Danaans to fight these; since themselves they did not</p>
	<p id="IL.5.521">fear the force of the men of Troy nor their charges onward,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.522">but stayed where they were, like clouds, which the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.5.523">stops in the windless weather on the heights of the towering mountains,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.524">motionless, when the strength of the north wind sleeps, and the other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.525">tearing winds, those winds that when they blow into tempests</p>
	<p id="IL.5.526">high screaming descend upon the darkening clouds and scatter them.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.527">So the Danaans stood steady against the Trojans, nor gave way.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.528">And Atreus' son ranged through the masses with his many orders:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.529">'Be men now, dear friends, and take up the heart of courage,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.530">and have consideration for each other in the strong encounters,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.531">since more come through alive when men consider each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.532">and there is no glory when they give way, nor warcraft either.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.533">He spoke, and made a swift cast with his spear, and struck down a great man</p>
	<p id="IL.5.534">Deïkoön, companion of high-hearted Aineias,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.535">Pergasos' son, whom the Trojans honoured as they honoured Priam's</p>
	<p id="IL.5.536">children, since he was a swift man to fight in the foremost.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.537">Powerful Agamemnon struck his shield with spear, nor</p>
	<p id="IL.5.538">could the shield hold off the spear, but the bronze smashed clean through</p>
	<p id="IL.5.539">and was driven on through the belt to the deep of the belly.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.540">He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.541">Now Aineias killed two great men of the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.542">the sons of Diokles, Orsilochos and Krethon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.543">men whose father dwelt in Phere the strong-founded,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.544">rich in substance, and his generation was of the river</p>
	<p id="IL.5.545">Alpheios, who flows wide through the country of the Pylians,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.546">and who got a son, Ortilochos, to be lord over many</p>
	<p id="IL.5.547">men, but the son of Ortilochos was high-hearted Diokles;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.548">and to Diokles in his turn were two twin sons born,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.549">Orsilochos and Krethon, both well skilled in all fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.550">These two as they were grown to young manhood followed along with</p>
	<p id="IL.5.551">the Argives in their black ships to Ilion, land of good horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.552">winning honour for the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.553">and Menelaos; now fulfilment of death was a darkness upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.554">These, as two young lions in the high places of the mountains,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.555">had been raised by their mother in the dark of the deep forest,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.556">lions which as they prey upon the cattle and the fat sheep</p>
	<p id="IL.5.557">lay waste the steadings where there are men, until they also</p>
	<p id="IL.5.558">fall and are killed under the cutting bronze in the men's hands;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.559">such were these two who beaten under the hands of Aineias</p>
	<p id="IL.5.560">crashed now to the ground as if they were two tall pine trees.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.561">As these fell warlike Menelaos took pity on them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.562">and he strode out among the champions, helmed in bright bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.563">shaking his spear, and the fury of Ares drove him onward,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.564">minded that he might go down under the hands of Aineias.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.565">But Antilochos, son of high-hearted Nestor, watched him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.566">and he strode among the champions in fear for the shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.567">lest he be hurt, and all their labour slip away into nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.568">So as Aineias and Menelaos raised hand and sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.569">standing to face each other and furious to do battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.570">Antilochos took his stand close beside the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.571">Nor did Aineias hold his ground, though yet a swift fighter,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.572">as he saw two men staying with each other against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.573">These, when they had dragged back the bodies among the Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.5.574">people, dropped the poor youths into the hands of their company,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.575">and themselves wheeled about once more to fight among the foremost.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.576">There these killed Pylaimenes the equal of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.577">lord of the Paphlagonian men in armour, high-hearted.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.578">Menelaos the spear-famed, son of Atreus, stabbed him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.579">with the spear as he stood his ground, and struck the collar-bone,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.580">while Antilochos struck down Mydon, his charioteer and</p>
	<p id="IL.5.581">henchman, Atymnios' brave son, as he wheeled the single-foot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.582">horses about, with a stone striking mid-elbow, and from his</p>
	<p id="IL.5.583">hands the reins pale with ivory dropped in the dust groundling.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.584">Antilochos charging drove the sword into his temple,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.585">so that gasping he dropped from the carefully wrought chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.586">headlong, driven deep in the dust his neck and shoulders;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.587">and there, since he chanced to light in a depth of sand, he stuck fast</p>
	<p id="IL.5.588">while his horses trampled him into the dust with their feet. These</p>
	<p id="IL.5.589">Antilochos lashed and drove back into the host of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.590">Hektor saw them across the ranks, and drove on against them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.591">crying aloud, and with him followed the Trojan battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.5.592">in their strength; and Ares led them with the goddess Enyo,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.593">she carrying with her the turmoil of shameless hatred</p>
	<p id="IL.5.594">while Ares made play in his hands with the spear gigantic</p>
	<p id="IL.5.595">and ranged now in front of Hektor and now behind him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.596">Diomedes of the great war cry shivered as he saw him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.597">and like a man in his helplessness who, crossing a great plain,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.598">stands at the edge of a fast-running river that dashes seaward,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.599">and watches it thundering into white water, and leaps a pace backward,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.600">so now Tydeus' son gave back, and spoke to his people:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.601">'Friends, although we know the wonder of glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.5.602">to be a fighter with the spear and a bold man of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.603">yet there goes ever some god beside him, who beats off destruction,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.604">and now, in the likeness of a man mortal, Ares goes with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.605">Come then, keeping your faces turned to the Trojans, give ground</p>
	<p id="IL.5.606">backward, nor be we eager to fight in strength with divinities.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.607">He spoke, and now the Trojans had come very close upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.608">There Hektor cut down two men, well skilled in warcraft,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.609">Anchialos and Menesthes both in a single chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.610">As these fell great Telamonian Aias pitied them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.611">and stood close in and made a cast with the shining javelin,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.612">and struck Amphios, Selagos' son, who rich in possessions</p>
	<p id="IL.5.613">and rich in cornland had lived in Paisos, but his own destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.5.614">brought him companion in arms to Priam and the children of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.615">Now Telamonian Aias struck him beneath the war belt</p>
	<p id="IL.5.616">and the far-shadowing spear was fixed in the lower belly,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.617">and he fell, thunderously, and shining Aias ran forward</p>
	<p id="IL.5.618">to strip his armour, but the Trojans showered spears upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.619">sharp spears and glittering, and the great shield caught many.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.620">Setting his heel on the chest of the corpse he pulled out the brazen</p>
	<p id="IL.5.621">spear, yet could no longer strip the rest of the glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.5.622">armour from his shoulders, since he was battered with spears thrown,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.623">and he dreaded the strong circle made by the haughty Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.624">who many and valiant stood over him, gripping their great spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.625">and though he was a mighty man and a strong and a proud one</p>
	<p id="IL.5.626">thrust him away from them so that he gave ground backward staggering.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.627">So they went at their work all about the strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.628">But Herakles' son Tlepolemos the huge and mighty</p>
	<p id="IL.5.629">was driven by his strong destiny against godlike Sarpedon.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.630">Now as these in their advance had come close together,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.631">the own son, and the son's son of Zeus cloud-gathering,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.632">it was Tlepolemos of the two who spoke the first word:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.633">'Man of counsel of the Lykians, Sarpedon, why must you</p>
	<p id="IL.5.634">be skulking here, you who are a man unskilled in the fighting?</p>
	<p id="IL.5.635">They are liars who call you issue of Zeus, the holder</p>
	<p id="IL.5.636">of the aegis, since you fall far short in truth of the others</p>
	<p id="IL.5.637">who were begotten of Zeus in the generations before us:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.638">such men as, they say, was the great strength of Herakles,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.639">my own father, of the daring spirit, the heart of a lion:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.640">he came here on a time for the sake of Laomedon's horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.641">with six vessels only and the few men needed to man them,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.642">and widowed the streets of Ilion and sacked the city;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.643">but yours is the heart of a coward and your people are dying.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.644">And I think that now, though you are come from Lykia, you will</p>
	<p id="IL.5.645">bring no help to the Trojans even though you be a strong man,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.646">but beaten down by my hands will pass through the gates of Hades.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.647">In turn the lord of the Lykians, Sarpedon, answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.648">'In truth, Tlepolemos, he did destroy Ilion the sacred</p>
	<p id="IL.5.649">through the senselessness of one man, the haughty Laomedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.650">who gave Herakles an evil word in return for good treatment</p>
	<p id="IL.5.651">and would not give up the horses for whose sake he had come from far off.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.652">But I tell you, what you will win from me here will be death</p>
	<p id="IL.5.653">and black destruction; and broken under my spear you will give me</p>
	<p id="IL.5.654">glory, and give your soul to Hades of the famed horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.655">So spoke Sarpedon, while the other lifted his ash spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.656">Tlepolemos; and in a single moment the long shafts</p>
	<p id="IL.5.657">shot from their hands, Sarpedon striking him in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.5.658">of the throat, and the agonizing spear drove clean through</p>
	<p id="IL.5.659">and over his eyes was mantled the covering mist of darkness.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.660">But Tlepolemos in turn had struck Sarpedon with the long spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.661">in the left thigh, and the spear smashed on through in fury</p>
	<p id="IL.5.662">scraping the bone, but his father fended destruction away from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.663">But his brilliant companions carried godlike Sarpedon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.664">out of the fighting, weighted down as he was by the long spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.665">which dragged, yet not one of them noticed nor took thought,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.666">in their urgency, to pull out of his thigh the ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.667">so he might stand, such hard work did they have attending him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.668">On the other side the strong-greaved Achaians carried Tlepolemos</p>
	<p id="IL.5.669">out of the fighting; but brilliant Odysseus, who held a hardy</p>
	<p id="IL.5.670">spirit, saw what had happened, and his heart within was stirred up,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.671">but now he pondered two ways within, in mind and in spirit,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.672">whether first to go after the son of Zeus the loud-thundering</p>
	<p id="IL.5.673">or whether he should strip the life from more of the Lykians.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.674">Yet, as it was not the destiny of great-hearted Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.5.675">to kill with sharp bronze the strong son of Zeus, therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.5.676">Athene steered his anger against the host of the Lykians.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.677">And there he killed Koiranos, and Chromios, and Alastor,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.678">Halios and Alkandros, and Prytanis and Noemon.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.679">And now might brilliant Odysseus have killed yet more of the Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.5.680">had not tall Hektor of the shining helmet sharply perceived him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.681">who strode out among the champions helmed in the bright bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.5.682">bringing terror to the Danaans; but Zeus' son, Sarpedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.683">was glad as he saw him come up, and piteously bespoke him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.684">'Son of Priam, do not leave me lying for the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.5.685">to prey upon, but protect me, since otherwise in your city</p>
	<p id="IL.5.686">my life must come to an end, since I could return no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.5.687">back to my own house and the land of my fathers, bringing</p>
	<p id="IL.5.688">joy to my own beloved wife and my son, still a baby.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.689">He spoke, but Hektor of the shining helm did not answer</p>
	<p id="IL.5.690">but swept on past him in his eagerness with all speed</p>
	<p id="IL.5.691">to push back the Argives and strip the life out of many.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.692">Meanwhile his brilliant companions laid godlike Sarpedon</p>
	<p id="IL.5.693">under a lovely spreading oak of Zeus of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.694">and strong Pelagon, one of his beloved companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.695">pushed perforce through and out of his thigh the shaft of the ash spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.696">And the mist mantled over his eyes, and the life left him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.697">but he got his breath back again, and the blast of the north wind</p>
	<p id="IL.5.698">blowing brought back to life the spirit gasped out in agony.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.699">But the Argives under the strength of Ares and bronze-armoured Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.5.700">did not ever turn their backs and make for their black ships</p>
	<p id="IL.5.701">nor yet stand up to them in fighting, but always backward</p>
	<p id="IL.5.702">gave way, as they saw how Ares went with the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.703">Who then was the first and who the last that they slaughtered,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.704">Hektor, Priam's son, and Ares the brazen? Godlike</p>
	<p id="IL.5.705">Teuthras first, and next Orestes, driver of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.706">Trechos the spearman of Aitolia and Oinomaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.707">Helenos son of Oinops and Oresbios of the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.5.708">guard, who had lived in Hyle much concerned with his property</p>
	<p id="IL.5.709">in a place hard on the Kephisian mere, and beside him other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.710">men of Boiotia lived and held the fine fertile country.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.711">Now as the goddess Hera of the white arms perceived how</p>
	<p id="IL.5.712">the Argives were perishing in the strong encounter,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.713">immediately she spoke to Pallas Athene her winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.714">'For shame, now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.715">nothing then meant the word we promised to Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.716">to go home after sacking the strong-walled city of Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.717">if we are to let cursed Ares be so furious.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.718">Come then, let us rather think of our own stark courage.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.719">So she spoke, nor did the goddess grey-eyed Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.5.720">disobey her. But Hera, high goddess, daughter of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.5.721">the mighty, went away to harness the gold-bridled horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.722">Then Hebe in speed set about the chariot the curved wheels</p>
	<p id="IL.5.723">eight-spoked and brazen, with an axle of iron both ways.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.724">Golden is the wheel's felly imperishable, and outside it</p>
	<p id="IL.5.725">is joined, a wonder to look upon, the brazen running-rim,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.726">and the silver naves revolve on either side of the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.727">whereas the car itself is lashed fast with plaiting of gold</p>
	<p id="IL.5.728">and silver, with double chariot rails that circle about it,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.729">and the pole of the chariot is of silver, to whose extremity</p>
	<p id="IL.5.730">Hebe made fast the golden and splendid yoke, and fastened</p>
	<p id="IL.5.731">the harness, golden and splendid, and underneath the yoke Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.732">furious for hate and battle, led the swift-running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.733">Now in turn Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.734">beside the threshold of her father slipped off her elaborate</p>
	<p id="IL.5.735">dress which she herself had wrought with her hands' patience,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.736">and now assuming the war tunic of Zeus who gathers</p>
	<p id="IL.5.737">the clouds, she armed in her gear for the dismal fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.738">And across her shoulders she threw the betasselled, terrible</p>
	<p id="IL.5.739">aegis, all about which Terror hangs like a garland,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.740">and Hatred is there, and Battle Strength, and heart-freezing Onslaught</p>
	<p id="IL.5.741">and thereon is set the head of the grim gigantic Gorgon,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.742">a thing of fear and horror, portent of Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.743">Upon her head she set the golden helm with its four sheets</p>
	<p id="IL.5.744">and two horns, wrought with the fighting men of a hundred cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.745">She set her feet in the blazing chariot and took up a spear</p>
	<p id="IL.5.746">heavy, huge, thick, wherewith she beats down the battalions of fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.747">men, against whom she of mighty father is angered.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.748">Hera laid the lash swiftly on the horses; and moving</p>
	<p id="IL.5.749">of themselves groaned the gates of the sky that the Hours guarded,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.750">those Hours to whose charge is given the huge sky and Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.751">to open up the dense darkness or again to close it.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.752">Through the way between they held the speed of their goaded horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.753">They found the son of Kronos sitting apart from the other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.754">gods, upon the highest peak of rugged Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.755">There the goddess of the white arms, Hera, stopping her horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.756">spoke to Zeus, high son of Kronos, and asked him a question:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.757">'Father Zeus, are you not angry with Ares for his violent</p>
	<p id="IL.5.758">acts, for killing so many and such good Achaian warriors</p>
	<p id="IL.5.759">for no reason, and out of due order, to grieve me? And meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.5.760">Kypris and Apollo of the silver bow take their ease and their pleasure</p>
	<p id="IL.5.761">having let loose this maniac who knows nothing of justice.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.762">Father Zeus, would you be angry with me if I were</p>
	<p id="IL.5.763">to smite Ares with painful strokes and drive him out of the fighting?'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.764">Then in turn the father of gods and men made answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.765">'Go to it then, and set against him the spoiler Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.766">who beyond all others is the one to visit harsh pains upon him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.767">So he spoke, nor did the goddess of the white arms, Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.768">disobey, but lashed on the horses, and they winged their way unreluctant</p>
	<p id="IL.5.769">through the space between the earth and the starry heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.770">As far as into the hazing distance a man can see with</p>
	<p id="IL.5.771">his eyes, who sits in his eyrie gazing on the wine-blue water,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.772">as far as this is the stride of the gods' proud neighing horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.773">Now as they came to Troy land and the two running rivers</p>
	<p id="IL.5.774">where Simoeis and Skamandros dash their waters together,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.775">there the goddess of the white arms, Hera, stayed her horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.776">slipping them from the chariot, and drifting close mist about them,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.777">and Simoeis grew as grass ambrosia for them to graze on.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.778">Now these two walked forward in little steps like shivering</p>
	<p id="IL.5.779">doves, in their eagerness to stand by the men of Argos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.780">after they had come to the place where the most and the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.5.781">stood close huddled about the great strength of the breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.782">Diomedes; in the likeness of lions who rend their meat raw,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.783">or wild pigs, boars, in whom the strength diminishes never,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.784">there standing the goddess of the white arms, Hera, shouted,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.785">likening herself to high-hearted, bronze-voiced Stentor,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.786">who could cry out in as great a voice as fifty other men:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.787">'Shame, you Argives, poor nonentities splendid to look on.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.788">In those days when brilliant Achilleus came into the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.789">never would the Trojans venture beyond the Dardanian</p>
	<p id="IL.5.790">gates, so much did they dread the heavy spear of that man.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.791">Now they fight by the hollow ships and far from the city.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.792">So she spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.793">But the goddess grey-eyed Athene made straight for Tydeus'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.794">son, and found the king standing by his horses and chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.795">cooling the wound that Pandaros made with the cast of his arrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.796">For the sweat made him sore underneath the broad strap of the circled</p>
	<p id="IL.5.797">shield; this made him sore, and his arm was tired. He held up</p>
	<p id="IL.5.798">the shield-strap, and wiped the dark blot of blood away from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.799">The goddess laid hold of the harnessed horses and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.800">'Tydeus got him a son who is little enough like him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.801">since Tydeus was a small man for stature, but he was a fighter.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.802">Even on that time when I would not consent to his fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.803">nor drawing men's eyes, when he went by himself without the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.5.804">as a messenger to Thebe among all the Kadmeians,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.805">then I invited him to feast at his ease in their great halls;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.806">even so, keeping that heart of strength that was always within him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.807">he challenged the young men of the Kadmeians, and defeated all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.5.808">easily; such a helper was I who stood then beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.809">Now beside you also I stand and ever watch over you,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.810">and urge you to fight confidently with the Trojans. And yet</p>
	<p id="IL.5.811">the weariness has entered your limbs from many encounters,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.812">or else it is some poor-spirited fear that holds you. If so,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.813">you are no issue then of the son of wise Oineus, Tydeus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.814">Then in answer powerful Diomedes spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.815">'Daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis, goddess, I know you,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.816">and therefore will speak confidently to you, and hide nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.817">It is no poor-spirited fear nor shrinking that holds me.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.818">Rather I remember the orders you yourself gave me</p>
	<p id="IL.5.819">when you would not let me fight in the face of the blessed immortals--</p>
	<p id="IL.5.820">the rest of them, except only if Aphrodite, Zeus' daughter,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.821">went into the fighting, I might stab at her with the sharp bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.822">Therefore now have I myself given way, and I ordered</p>
	<p id="IL.5.823">the rest of the Argives all to be gathered in this place beside me,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.824">since I see that this who is lord of the fighting is Ares.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.825">Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.826">'Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.827">no longer be thus afraid of Ares, nor of any other</p>
	<p id="IL.5.828">immortal; such a helper shall I be standing beside you.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.829">Come then, first against Ares steer your single-foot horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.830">and strike him from close. Be not afraid of violent Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.831">that thing of fury, evil-wrought, that double-faced liar</p>
	<p id="IL.5.832">who even now protested to Hera and me, promising</p>
	<p id="IL.5.833">that he would fight against the Trojans and stand by the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.834">Now, all promises forgotten, he stands by the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.835">So speaking she pushed Sthenelos to the ground from the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.836">driving him back with her hand, and he leapt away from it lightly,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.837">and she herself, a goddess in her anger, stepped into the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.5.838">beside brilliant Diomedes, and the oaken axle groaned aloud</p>
	<p id="IL.5.839">under the weight, carrying a dread goddess and a great man.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.840">Pallas Athene then took up the whip and the reins, steering</p>
	<p id="IL.5.841">first of all straight on against Ares the single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.842">Ares was in the act of stripping gigantic Periphas,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.843">shining son of Ochesios, far the best of the men of Aitolia.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.844">Blood-stained Ares was in the act of stripping him. But Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.5.845">put on the helm of Death, that stark Ares might not discern her.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.846">Now as manslaughtering Ares caught sight of Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.5.847">the brilliant, he let gigantic Periphas lie in the place where</p>
	<p id="IL.5.848">he had first cut him down and taken the life away from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.849">and made straight against Diomedes, breaker of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.850">Now as they in their advance had come close together,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.851">Ares lunged first over the yoke and the reins of his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.5.852">with the bronze spear, furious to take the life from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.853">But the goddess grey-eyed Athene in her hand catching</p>
	<p id="IL.5.854">the spear pushed it away from the car, so he missed and stabbed vainly.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.855">After him Diomedes of the great war cry drove forward</p>
	<p id="IL.5.856">with the bronze spear; and Pallas Athene, leaning in on it,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.857">drove it into the depth of the belly where the war belt girt him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.858">Picking this place she stabbed and driving it deep in the fair flesh</p>
	<p id="IL.5.859">wrenched the spear out again. Then Ares the brazen bellowed</p>
	<p id="IL.5.860">with a sound as great as nine thousand men make, or ten thousand,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.861">when they cry as they carry into the fighting the fury of the war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.862">And a shivering seized hold alike on Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.5.863">in their fear at the bellowing of battle-insatiate Ares.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.864">As when out of the thunderhead the air shows darkening</p>
	<p id="IL.5.865">after a day's heat when the stormy wind uprises,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.866">thus to Tydeus' son Diomedes Ares the brazen</p>
	<p id="IL.5.867">showed as he went up with the clouds into the wide heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.868">Lightly he came to the gods' citadel, headlong Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.869">and sat down beside Kronian Zeus, grieving in his spirit,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.870">and showed him the immortal blood dripping from the spear cut.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.871">So in sorrow for himself he addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.872">'Father Zeus, are you not angry looking on these acts of violence?</p>
	<p id="IL.5.873">We who are gods forever have to endure the most horrible</p>
	<p id="IL.5.874">hurts, by each other's hatred, as we try to give favour to mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.875">It is your fault we fight, since you brought forth this maniac daughter</p>
	<p id="IL.5.876">accursed, whose mind is fixed forever on unjust action.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.877">For all the rest, as many as are gods on Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.878">are obedient to you, and we all have rendered ourselves submissive.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.879">Yet you say nothing and you do nothing to check this girl, letting</p>
	<p id="IL.5.880">her go free, since yourself you begot this child of perdition.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.881">See now, the son of Tydeus, Diomedes the haughty,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.882">she has egged on to lash out in fury against the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.5.883">gods. First he stabbed the Kyprian in the arm by the wrist. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.5.884">like something more than human he swept on even against me.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.885">But my swift feet took me out of the way. Otherwise I should</p>
	<p id="IL.5.886">long be lying there in pain among the stark dead men,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.887">or go living without strength because of the strokes of the bronze spear.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.888">Then looking at him darkly Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.5.889">'Do not sit beside me and whine, you double-faced liar.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.890">To me you are most hateful of all gods who hold Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.891">Forever quarrelling is dear to your heart, was and battles.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.892">Truly the anger of Hera your mother is grown out of all hand</p>
	<p id="IL.5.893">nor gives ground; and try as I may I am broken by her arguments,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.894">and it is by her impulse, I think, you are suffering all this.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.895">And yet I will not long endure to see you in pain, since</p>
	<p id="IL.5.896">you are my child, and it was to me that your mother bore you.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.897">But were you born of some other god and proved so ruinous</p>
	<p id="IL.5.898">long since you would have been dropped beneath the gods of the bright sky.'</p>
	<p id="IL.5.899">So he spoke, and told Paiëon to heal him; and scattering</p>
	<p id="IL.5.900">medicines to still pain upon him Paiëon rendered him</p>
	<p id="IL.5.901">well again, since he was not made to be one of the mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.902">As when the juice of the fig in white milk rapidly fixes</p>
	<p id="IL.5.903">that which was fluid before and curdles quickly for one who</p>
	<p id="IL.5.904">stirs it; in such speed as this he healed violent Ares;</p>
	<p id="IL.5.905">and Hebe washed him clean and put delicate clothing upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.906">And rejoicing in the glory of his strength he sat down beside Kronion.</p>
	<p id="IL.5.907">Meanwhile, the two went back again to the house of great Zeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.908">Hera of Argos, with Athene who stands by her people,</p>
	<p id="IL.5.909">after they stopped the murderous work of manslaughtering Ares.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.1">So the grim encounter of Achaians and Trojans was left</p>
	<p id="IL.6.2">to itself, and the battle veered greatly now one way, now in another,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.3">over the plain as they guided their bronze spears at each other</p>
	<p id="IL.6.4">in the space between the waters of Xanthos and Simoeis.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.5">First Telamonian Aias, that bastion of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.6">broke the Trojan battalions and brought light to his own company,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.7">striking down the man who was far the best of the Thracians,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.8">Akamas, the huge and mighty, the son of Eussoros.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.9">Throwing first, he struck the horn of the horse-haired helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.6.10">and the bronze spear-point fixed in his forehead and drove inward</p>
	<p id="IL.6.11">through the bone; and a mist of darkness clouded both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.12">Diomedes of the great war cry cut down Axylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.13">Teuthras' son, who had been a dweller in strong-founded Arisbe,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.14">a man rich in substance and a friend to all humanity</p>
	<p id="IL.6.15">since in his house by the wayside he entertained all comers.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.16">Yet there was none of these now to stand before him and keep off</p>
	<p id="IL.6.17">the sad destruction, and Diomedes stripped life from both of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.18">Axylos and his henchman Kalesios, who was the driver</p>
	<p id="IL.6.19">guiding his horses; so down to the underworld went both men.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.20">Now Euryalos slaughtered Opheltios and Dresos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.21">and went in pursuit of Aisepos and Pedasos, those whom the naiad</p>
	<p id="IL.6.22">nymph Abarbare had born to blameless Boukolion.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.23">Boukolion himself was the son of haughty Laomedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.24">eldest born, but his mother conceived him in darkness and secrecy.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.25">While shepherding his flocks he lay with the nymph and loved her,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.26">and she conceiving bore him twin boys. But now Mekistios'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.27">son unstrung the strength of these and the limbs in their glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.28">Euryalos, and stripped the armour away from their shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.29">Polypoites the stubborn in battle cut down Astyalos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.30">while Odysseus slaughtered one from Perkote, Pidytes,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.31">with the bronze spear, and great Aretaon was killed by Teukros.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.32">Nestor's son Antilochos with the shining shaft killed</p>
	<p id="IL.6.33">Ableros; the lord of men, Agamemnon, brought death to Elatos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.34">whose home had been on the shores of Satnioeis' lovely waters,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.35">sheer Pedasos. And Leitos the fighter caught Phylakos</p>
	<p id="IL.6.36">as he ran away; and Eurypylos made an end of Melanthios.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.37">Now Menelaos of the great war cry captured Adrestos</p>
	<p id="IL.6.38">alive; for his two horses bolting over the level land</p>
	<p id="IL.6.39">got entangled in a tamarisk growth, and shattered the curving</p>
	<p id="IL.6.40">chariot at the tip of the pole; so they broken free went</p>
	<p id="IL.6.41">on toward the city, where many beside stampeded in terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.42">So Adrestos was whirled beside the wheel from the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.6.43">headlong into the dust on his face; and the son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.44">Menelaos, with the far-shadowed spear in his hand, stood over him.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.45">But Adrestos, catching him by the knees, supplicated:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.46">'Take me alive, son of Atreus, and take appropriate ransom.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.47">In my rich father's house the treasures lie piled in abundance;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.48">bronze is there, and gold, and difficultly wrought iron,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.49">and my father would make you glad with abundant repayment</p>
	<p id="IL.6.50">were he to hear that I am alive by the ships of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.51">So he spoke, and moved the spirit inside Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.52">And now he was on the point of handing him to a henchman</p>
	<p id="IL.6.53">to lead back to the fast Achaian ships; but Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.6.54">came on the run to join him and spoke his word of argument:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.55">'Dear brother, o Menelaos, are you concerned so tenderly</p>
	<p id="IL.6.56">with these people? Did you in your house get the best of treatment</p>
	<p id="IL.6.57">from the Trojans? No, let not one of them go free of sudden</p>
	<p id="IL.6.58">death and our hands; not the young man child that the mother carries</p>
	<p id="IL.6.59">still in her body, not even he, but let all of Ilion's</p>
	<p id="IL.6.60">people perish, utterly blotted out and unmourned for.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.61">The hero spoke like this, and bent the heart of his brother</p>
	<p id="IL.6.62">since he urged justice. Menelaos shoved with his hand Adrestos</p>
	<p id="IL.6.63">the warrior back from him, and powerful Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.6.64">stabbed him in the side and, as he writhed over, Atreides,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.65">setting his heel upon the midriff, wrenched out the ash spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.66">Nestor in a great voice cried out to the men of Argos:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.67">'O beloved Danaan fighters, henchmen of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.68">let no man any more hang back with his eye on the plunder</p>
	<p id="IL.6.69">designing to take all the spoil he can gather back to the vessels;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.70">let us kill the men now, and afterwards at your leisure</p>
	<p id="IL.6.71">all along the plain you can plunder the perished corpses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.72">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.73">Then once more would the Trojans have climbed back into Ilion's</p>
	<p id="IL.6.74">wall, subdued by terror before the warlike Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.75">had not Priam's son, Helenos, best by far of the augurs,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.76">stood beside Aineias and Hektor and spoken a word to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.77">'Hektor and Aineias, on you beyond others is leaning</p>
	<p id="IL.6.78">the battle-work of Trojans and Lykians, since you are our greatest</p>
	<p id="IL.6.79">in every course we take, whether it be in thought or in fighting:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.80">stand your ground here; visit your people everywhere; hold them</p>
	<p id="IL.6.81">fast by the gates, before they tumble into their women's</p>
	<p id="IL.6.82">arms, and become to our enemies a thing to take joy in.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.83">Afterwards, when you have set all the battalions in motion,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.84">the rest of us will stand fast here and fight with the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.6.85">though we are very hard hit indeed; necessity forces us;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.86">but you, Hektor, go back again to the city, and there tell</p>
	<p id="IL.6.87">your mother and mine to assemble all the ladies of honour</p>
	<p id="IL.6.88">at the temple of grey-eyed Athene high on the citadel;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.89">there opening with a key the door to the sacred chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.6.90">let her take a robe, which seems to her the largest and loveliest</p>
	<p id="IL.6.91">in the great house, and that which is far her dearest possession,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.92">and lay it along the knees of Athene the lovely haired. Let her</p>
	<p id="IL.6.93">promise to dedicate within the shrine twelve heifers,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.94">yearlings, never broken, if only she will have pity</p>
	<p id="IL.6.95">on the town of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent children.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.96">So she might hold back from sacred Ilion the son of Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.97">that wild spear-fighter, the strong one who drives men to thoughts of terror,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.98">who I say now is become the strongest of all the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.99">For never did we so fear Achilleus even, that leader</p>
	<p id="IL.6.100">of men, who they say was born of a goddess. This man has gone clean</p>
	<p id="IL.6.101">berserk, so that no one can match his warcraft against him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.102">So he spoke, and Hektor did not disobey his brother,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.103">but at once in all his armour leapt to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.6.104">and shaking two sharp spears in his hands ranged over the whole host</p>
	<p id="IL.6.105">stirring them up to fight and waking the ghastly warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.106">So they whirled about and stood their ground against the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.107">and the Argives gave way backward and stopped their slaughtering,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.108">and thought some one of the immortals must have descended</p>
	<p id="IL.6.109">from the starry sky to stand by the Trojans, the way they rallied.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.110">But Hektor lifted his voice and cried aloud to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.111">'You high-hearted Trojans and far-renowned companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.112">be men now, dear friends, and remember your furious valour</p>
	<p id="IL.6.113">until I can go back again to Ilion, and there tell</p>
	<p id="IL.6.114">the elder men who sit as counsellors, and our own wives,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.115">to make their prayer to the immortals and promise them hecatombs.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.116">So spoke Hektor of the shining helm, and departed;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.117">and against his ankles as against his neck clashed the dark ox-hide,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.118">the rim running round the edge of the great shield massive in the midd</p>
	<p id="IL.6.119">Now Glaukos, sprung of Hippolochos, and the son of Tydeus</p>
	<p id="IL.6.120">came together in the space between the two armies, battle-bent.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.121">Now as these advancing came to one place and encountered,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.122">first to speak was Diomedes of the great war cry:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.123">'Who among mortal men are you, good friend? Since never</p>
	<p id="IL.6.124">before have I seen you in the fighting where men win glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.125">yet now you have come striding far out in front of all others</p>
	<p id="IL.6.126">in your great heart, who have dared stand up to my spear far-shadowing.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.127">Yet unhappy are those whose sons match warcraft against me.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.128">But if you are some one of the immortals come down from the bright sky,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.129">know that I will not fight against any god of the heaven,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.130">since even the son of Dryas, Lykourgos the powerful, did not</p>
	<p id="IL.6.131">live long; he who tried to fight with the gods of the bright sky,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.132">who once drove the fosterers of rapturous Dionysos</p>
	<p id="IL.6.133">headlong down the sacred Nyseian hill, and all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.6.134">shed and scattered their wands on the ground, stricken with an ox-goad</p>
	<p id="IL.6.135">by murderous Lykourgos, while Dionysos in terror</p>
	<p id="IL.6.136">dived into the salt surf, and Thetis took him to her bosom,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.137">frightened, with the strong shivers upon him at the man's blustering.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.138">But the gods who live at their ease were angered with Lykourgos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.139">and the son of Kronos struck him to blindness, nor did he live long</p>
	<p id="IL.6.140">afterwards, since he was hated by all the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.141">Therefore neither would I be willing to fight with the blessed</p>
	<p id="IL.6.142">gods; but if you are one of those mortals who eat what the soil yields,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.143">come nearer, so that sooner you may reach your appointed destruction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.144">Then in turn the shining son of Hippolochos answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.145">'High-hearted son of Tydeus, why ask of my generation?</p>
	<p id="IL.6.146">As is the generation of leaves, so is that of humanity.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.147">The wind scatters the leaves on the ground, but the live timber</p>
	<p id="IL.6.148">burgeons with leaves again in the season of spring returning.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.149">So one generation of men will grow while another</p>
	<p id="IL.6.150">dies. Yet if you wish to learn all this and be certain</p>
	<p id="IL.6.151">of my genealogy: there are plenty of men who know it.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.152">There is a city, Ephyre, in the corner of horse-pasturing</p>
	<p id="IL.6.153">Argos; there lived Sisyphos, that sharpest of all men,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.154">Sisyphos, Aiolos' son, and he had a son named Glaukos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.155">and Glaukos in turn sired Bellerophontes the blameless.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.156">To Bellerophontes the gods granted beauty and desirable</p>
	<p id="IL.6.157">manhood; but Proitos in anger devised evil things against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.158">and drove him out of his own domain, since he was far greater,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.159">from the Argive country Zeus had broken to the sway of his sceptre.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.160">Beautiful Anteia the wife of Proitos was stricken</p>
	<p id="IL.6.161">with passion to lie in love with him, and yet she could not</p>
	<p id="IL.6.162">beguile valiant Bellerophontes, whose will was virtuous.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.163">So she went to Proitos the king and uttered her falsehood:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.164">"Would you be killed, o Proitos? Then murder Bellerophontes</p>
	<p id="IL.6.165">who tried to lie with me in love, though I was unwilling."</p>
	<p id="IL.6.166">So she spoke, and anger took hold of the king at her story.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.167">He shrank from killing him, since his heart was awed by such action,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.168">but sent him away to Lykia, and handed him murderous symbols,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.169">which he inscribed in a folding tablet, enough to destroy life,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.170">and told him to show it to his wife's father, that he might perish.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.171">Bellerophontes went to Lykia in the blameless convoy</p>
	<p id="IL.6.172">of the gods; when he came to the running stream of Xanthos, and Lykia,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.173">the lord of wide Lykia tendered him full-hearted honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.174">Nine days he entertained him with sacrifice of nine oxen,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.175">but afterwards when the rose fingers of the tenth dawn showed, then</p>
	<p id="IL.6.176">he began to question him, and asked to be shown the symbols,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.177">whatever he might be carrying from his son-in-law, Proitos.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.178">Then after he had been given his son-in-law's wicked symbols</p>
	<p id="IL.6.179">first he sent him away with orders to kill the Chimaira</p>
	<p id="IL.6.180">none might approach; a thing of immortal make, not human,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.181">lion-fronted and snake behind, a goat in the middle,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.182">and snorting out the breath of the terrible flame of bright fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.183">He killed the Chimaira, obeying the portents of the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.184">Next after this he fought against the glorious Solymoi,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.185">and this he thought was the strongest battle with men that he entered;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.186">but third he slaughtered the Amazons, who fight men in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.187">Now as he came back the king spun another entangling</p>
	<p id="IL.6.188">treachery; for choosing the bravest men in wide Lykia</p>
	<p id="IL.6.189">he laid a trap, but these men never came home thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.6.190">since all of them were killed by blameless Bellerophontes.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.191">Then when the king knew him for the powerful stock of the god,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.192">he detained him there, and offered him the hand of his daughter,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.193">and gave him half of all the kingly privilege. Thereto</p>
	<p id="IL.6.194">the men of Lykia cut out a piece of land, surpassing</p>
	<p id="IL.6.195">all others, fine ploughland and orchard for him to administer.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.196">His bride bore three children to valiant Bellerophontes,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.197">Isandros and Hippolochos and Laodameia.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.198">Laodameia lay in love beside Zeus of the counsels</p>
	<p id="IL.6.199">and bore him godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helmet.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.200">But after Bellerophontes was hated by all the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.201">he wandered alone about the plain of Aleios, eating</p>
	<p id="IL.6.202">his heart out, skulking aside from the trodden track of humanity.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.203">As for Isandros his son, Ares the insatiate of fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.6.204">killed him in close battle against the glorious Solymoi,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.205">while Artemis of the golden reins killed the daughter in anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.206">But Hippolochos begot me, and I claim that he is my father;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.207">he sent me to Troy, and urged upon me repeated injunctions,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.208">to be always among the bravest, and hold my head above others,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.209">not shaming the generation of my fathers, who were</p>
	<p id="IL.6.210">the greatest men in Ephyre and again in wide Lykia.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.211">Such is my generation and the blood I claim to be born from.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.212">He spoke, and Diomedes of the great war cry was gladdened.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.213">He drove his spear deep into the prospering earth, and in winning</p>
	<p id="IL.6.214">words of friendliness he spoke to the shepherd of the people:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.215">'See now, you are my guest friend from far in the time of our fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.216">Brilliant Oineus once was host to Bellerophontes</p>
	<p id="IL.6.217">the blameless, in his halls, and twenty days he detained him,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.218">and these two gave to each other fine gifts in token of friendship.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.219">Oineus gave his guest a war belt bright with the red dye,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.220">Bellerophontes a golden and double-handled drinking-cup,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.221">a thing I left behind in my house when I came on my journey.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.222">Tydeus, though, I cannot remember, since I was little</p>
	<p id="IL.6.223">when he left me, that time the people of the Achaians perished</p>
	<p id="IL.6.224">in Thebe. Therefore I am your friend and host in the heart of Argos;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.225">you are mine in Lykia, when I come to your country.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.226">Let us avoid each other's spears, even in the close fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.227">There are plenty of Trojans and famed companions in battle for me</p>
	<p id="IL.6.228">to kill, whom the god sends me, or those I run down with my swift feet,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.229">many Achaians for you to slaughter, if you can do it.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.230">But let us exchange our armour, so that these others may know</p>
	<p id="IL.6.231">how we claim to be guests and friends from the days of our fathers.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.232">So they spoke, and both springing down from behind their horses</p>
	<p id="IL.6.233">gripped each other's hands and exchanged the promise of friendship;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.234">but Zeus the son of Kronos stole away the wits of Glaukos</p>
	<p id="IL.6.235">who exchanged with Diomedes the son of Tydeus armour</p>
	<p id="IL.6.236">of gold for bronze, for nine oxen's worth the worth of a hundred.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.237">Now as Hektor had come to the Skaian gates and the oak tree,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.238">all the wives of the Trojans and their daughters came running about him</p>
	<p id="IL.6.239">to ask after their sons, after their brothers and neighbours,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.240">their husbands; and he told them to pray to the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.241">all, in turn; but there were sorrows in store for many.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.242">Now he entered the wonderfully built palace of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.243">This was fashioned with smooth-stone cloister walks, and within it</p>
	<p id="IL.6.244">were embodied fifty sleeping chambers of smoothed stone</p>
	<p id="IL.6.245">built so as to connect with each other; and within these slept</p>
	<p id="IL.6.246">each beside his own wedded wife, the sons of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.247">In the same inner court on the opposite side, to face these,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.248">lay the twelve close smooth-stone sleeping chambers of his daughters</p>
	<p id="IL.6.249">built so as to connect with each other; and within these slept,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.250">each by his own modest wife, the lords of the daughters of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.251">There there came to meet Hektor his bountiful mother</p>
	<p id="IL.6.252">with Laodike, the loveliest looking of all her daughters.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.253">She clung to his hand and called him by name and spoke to him: 'Why then,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.254">child, have you come here and left behind the bold battle?</p>
	<p id="IL.6.255">Surely it is these accursed sons of the Achaians who wear you</p>
	<p id="IL.6.256">out, as they fight close to the city, and the spirit stirred you</p>
	<p id="IL.6.257">to return, and from the peak of the citadel lift your hands, praying</p>
	<p id="IL.6.258">to Zeus. But stay while I bring you honey-sweet wine, to pour out</p>
	<p id="IL.6.259">a libation to father Zeus and the other immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.6.260">first, and afterwards if you will drink yourself, be strengthened.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.261">In a tired man, wine will bring back his strength to its bigness,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.262">in a man tired as you are tired, defending your neighbours.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.263">Tall Hektor of the shining helm spoke to her answering:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.264">'My honoured mother, lift not to me the kindly sweet wine,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.265">for fear you stagger my strength and make me forget my courage;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.266">and with hands unwashed I would take shame to pour the glittering</p>
	<p id="IL.6.267">wine to Zeus; there is no means for a man to pray to the dark-misted</p>
	<p id="IL.6.268">son of Kronos, with blood and muck all spattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.269">But go yourself to the temple of the spoiler Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.270">assembling the ladies of honour, and with things to be sacrificed,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.271">and take a robe, which seems to you the largest and loveliest</p>
	<p id="IL.6.272">in the great house, and that which is far your dearest possession.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.273">Lay this along the knees of Athene the lovely haired. Also</p>
	<p id="IL.6.274">promise to dedicate within the shrine twelve heifers,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.275">yearlings, never broken, if only she will have pity</p>
	<p id="IL.6.276">on the town of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent children,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.277">if she will hold back from sacred Ilion the son of Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.278">that wild spear-fighter, the strong one who drives men to thoughts of terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.279">So go yourself to the temple of the spoiler Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.280">while I go in search of Paris, to call him, if he will listen</p>
	<p id="IL.6.281">to anything I tell him. How I wish at this moment the earth might</p>
	<p id="IL.6.282">open beneath him. The Olympian let him live, a great sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.6.283">to the Trojans, and high-hearted Priam, and all of his children.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.284">If only I could see him gone down to the house of the Death God,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.285">then I could say my heart had forgotten its joyless affliction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.286">So he spoke, and she going into the great house called out</p>
	<p id="IL.6.287">to her handmaidens, who assembled throughout the city the highborn</p>
	<p id="IL.6.288">women; while she descended into the fragrant store-chamber.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.289">There lay the elaborately wrought robes, the work of Sidonian</p>
	<p id="IL.6.290">women, whom Alexandros himself, the godlike, had brought home</p>
	<p id="IL.6.291">from the land of Sidon, crossing the wide sea, on that journey</p>
	<p id="IL.6.292">when he brought back also gloriously descended Helen.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.293">Hekabe lifted out one and took it as gift to Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.294">that which was the loveliest in design and the largest,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.295">and shone like a star. It lay beneath the others. She went on</p>
	<p id="IL.6.296">her way, and a throng of noble women hastened about her.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.297">When these had come to Athene's temple on the peak of the citadel,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.298">Theano of the fair cheeks opened the door for them, daughter</p>
	<p id="IL.6.299">of Kisseus, and wife of Antenor, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.300">she whom the Trojans had established to be Athene's priestess.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.301">With a wailing cry all lifted up their hands to Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.302">and Theano of the fair cheeks taking up the robe laid it</p>
	<p id="IL.6.303">along the knees of Athene the lovely haired, and praying</p>
	<p id="IL.6.304">she supplicated the daughter of powerful Zeus: 'O lady,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.305">Athene, our city's defender, shining among goddesses:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.306">break the spear of Diomedes, and grant that the man be</p>
	<p id="IL.6.307">hurled on his face in front of the Skaian gates; so may we</p>
	<p id="IL.6.308">instantly dedicate within your shrine twelve heifers,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.309">yearlings, never broken, if only you will have pity</p>
	<p id="IL.6.310">on the town of Troy, and the Trojan wives, and their innocent children.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.311">She spoke in prayer, but Pallas Athene turned her head from her.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.312">So they made their prayer to the daughter of Zeus the powerful.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.313">But Hektor went away to the house of Alexandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.314">a splendid place he had built himself, with the men who at that time</p>
	<p id="IL.6.315">were the best men for craftsmanship in the generous Troad,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.316">who had made him a sleeping room and a hall and a courtyard</p>
	<p id="IL.6.317">near the houses of Hektor and Priam, on the peak of the citadel.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.318">There entered Hektor beloved of Zeus, in his hand holding</p>
	<p id="IL.6.319">the eleven-cubit-long spear, whose shaft was tipped with a shining</p>
	<p id="IL.6.320">bronze spearhead, and a ring of gold was hooped to hold it.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.321">He found the man in his chamber busy with his splendid armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.322">the corselet and the shield, and turning in his hands the curved bow,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.323">while Helen of Argos was sitting among her attendant women</p>
	<p id="IL.6.324">directing the magnificent work done by her handmaidens.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.325">But Hektor saw him, and in words of shame he rebuked him:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.326">'Strange man! It is not fair to keep in your heart this coldness.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.327">The people are dying around the city and around the steep wall</p>
	<p id="IL.6.328">as they fight hard; and it is for you that this war with its clamour</p>
	<p id="IL.6.329">has flared up about our city. You yourself would fight with another</p>
	<p id="IL.6.330">whom you saw anywhere hanging back from the hateful encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.331">Up then, to keep our town from burning at once in the hot fire.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.332">Then in answer the godlike Alexandros spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.333">'Hektor, seeing you have scolded me rightly, not beyond measure,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.334">therefore I will tell, and you in turn understand and listen.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.335">It was not so much in coldness and bitter will toward the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.6.336">that I sat in my room, but I wished to give myself over to sorrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.337">But just now with soft words my wife was winning me over</p>
	<p id="IL.6.338">and urging me into the fight, and that way seems to me also</p>
	<p id="IL.6.339">the better one. Victory passes back and forth between men.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.340">Come then, wait for me now while I put on my armour of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.341">or go, and I will follow, and I think I can overtake you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.342">He spoke, but Hektor of the shining helm gave him no answer,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.343">but Helen spoke to him in words of endearment: 'Brother</p>
	<p id="IL.6.344">by marriage to me, who am a nasty bitch evil-intriguing,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.345">how I wish that on that day when my mother first bore me</p>
	<p id="IL.6.346">the foul whirlwind of the storm had caught me away and swept me</p>
	<p id="IL.6.347">to the mountain, or into the wash of the sea deep-thundering</p>
	<p id="IL.6.348">where the waves would have swept me away before all these things had happened.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.349">Yet since the gods had brought it about that these vile things must be,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.350">I wish I had been the wife of a better man than this is,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.351">one who knew modesty and all things of shame that men say.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.352">But this man's heart is no steadfast thing, nor yet will it be so</p>
	<p id="IL.6.353">ever hereafter; for that I think he shall take the consequence.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.354">But come now, come in and rest on this chair, my brother,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.355">since it is on your heart beyond all that the hard work has fallen</p>
	<p id="IL.6.356">for the sake of dishonoured me and the blind act of Alexandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.357">us two, on whom Zeus set a vile destiny, so that hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.6.358">we shall be made into things of song for the men of the future.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.359">Then tall Hektor of the shining helm answered her: 'Do not, Helen,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.360">make me sit with you, though you love me. You will not persuade me.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.361">Already my heart within is hastening me to defend</p>
	<p id="IL.6.362">the Trojans, who when I am away long greatly to have me.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.363">Rather rouse this man, and let himself also be swift to action</p>
	<p id="IL.6.364">so he may overtake me while I am still in the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.365">For I am going first to my own house, so I can visit</p>
	<p id="IL.6.366">my own people, my beloved wife and my son, who is little,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.367">since I do not know if ever again I shall come back this way,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.368">or whether the gods will strike me down at the hands of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.369">So speaking Hektor of the shining helm departed</p>
	<p id="IL.6.370">and in speed made his way to his own well-established dwelling,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.371">but failed to find in the house Andromache of the white arms;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.372">for she, with the child, and followed by one fair-robed attendant,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.373">had taken her place on the tower in lamentation, and tearful.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.374">When he saw no sign of his perfect wife within the house, Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.6.375">stopped in his way on the threshold and spoke among the handmaidens:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.376">'Come then, tell me truthfully as you may, handmaidens:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.377">where has Andromache of the white arms gone? Is she</p>
	<p id="IL.6.378">with any of the sisters of her lord or the wives of his brothers?</p>
	<p id="IL.6.379">Or has she gone to the house of Athene, where all the other</p>
	<p id="IL.6.380">lovely-haired women of Troy propitiate the grim goddess?'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.381">Then in turn the hard-working housekeeper gave him an answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.382">'Hektor, since you have urged me to tell you the truth, she is not</p>
	<p id="IL.6.383">with any of the sisters of her lord or the wives of his brothers,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.384">nor has she gone to the house of Athene, where all the other</p>
	<p id="IL.6.385">lovely-haired women of Troy propitiate the grim goddess,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.386">but she has gone to the great bastion of Ilion, because she heard that</p>
	<p id="IL.6.387">the Trojans were losing, and great grew the strength of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.388">Therefore she has gone in speed to the wall, like a woman</p>
	<p id="IL.6.389">gone mad, and a nurse attending her carries the baby.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.390">So the housekeeper spoke, and Hektor hastened from his home</p>
	<p id="IL.6.391">backward by the way he had come through the well-laid streets. So</p>
	<p id="IL.6.392">as he had come to the gates on his way through the great city,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.393">the Skaian gates, whereby he would issue into the plain, there</p>
	<p id="IL.6.394">at last his own generous wife came running to meet him,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.395">Andromache, the daughter of high-hearted Eëtion;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.396">Eëtion, who had dwelt underneath wooded Plakos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.397">in Thebe below Plakos, lord over the Kilikian people.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.398">It was his daughter who was given to Hektor of the bronze helm.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.399">She came to him there, and beside her went an attendant carrying</p>
	<p id="IL.6.400">the boy in the fold of her bosom, a little child, only a baby,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.401">Hektor's son, the admired, beautiful as a star shining,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.402">whom Hektor called Skamandrios, but all of the others</p>
	<p id="IL.6.403">Astyanax--lord of the city; since Hektor alone saved Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.404">Hektor smiled in silence as he looked on his son, but she,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.405">Andromache, stood close beside him, letting her tears fall,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.406">and clung to his hand and called him by name and spoke to him: 'Dearest,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.407">your own great strength will be your death, and you have no pity</p>
	<p id="IL.6.408">on your little son, nor on me, ill-starred, who soon must be your widow;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.409">for presently the Achaians, gathering together,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.410">will set upon you and kill you; and for me it would be far better</p>
	<p id="IL.6.411">to sink into the earth when I have lost you, for there is no other</p>
	<p id="IL.6.412">consolation for me after you have gone to your destiny--</p>
	<p id="IL.6.413">only grief; since I have no father, no honoured mother.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.414">It was brilliant Achilleus who slew my father, Eëtion,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.415">when he stormed the strong-founded citadel of the Kilikians,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.416">Thebe of the towering gates. He killed Eëtion</p>
	<p id="IL.6.417">but did not strip his armour, for his heart respected the dead man,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.418">but burned the body in all its elaborate war-gear</p>
	<p id="IL.6.419">and piled a grave mound over it, and the nymphs of the mountains,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.420">daughters of Zeus of the aegis, planted elm trees about it.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.421">And they who were my seven brothers in the great house all went</p>
	<p id="IL.6.422">upon a single day down into the house of the death god,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.423">for swift-footed brilliant Achilleus slaughtered all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.6.424">as they were tending their white sheep and their lumbering oxen;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.425">and when he had led my mother, who was queen under wooded Plakos,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.426">here, along with all his other possessions, Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.6.427">released her again, accepting ransom beyond count, but Artemis</p>
	<p id="IL.6.428">of the showering arrows struck her down in the halls of her father.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.429">Hektor, thus you are father to me, and my honoured mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.430">you are my brother, and you it is who are my young husband.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.431">Please take pity upon me then, stay here on the rampart,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.432">that you may not leave your child an orphan, your wife a widow,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.433">but draw your people up by the fig tree, there where the city</p>
	<p id="IL.6.434">is openest to attack, and where the wall may be mounted.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.435">Three times their bravest came that way, and fought there to storm it</p>
	<p id="IL.6.436">about the two Aiantes and renowned Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.437">about the two Atreidai and the fighting son of Tydeus.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.438">Either some man well skilled in prophetic arts had spoken,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.439">or the very spirit within themselves had stirred them to the onslaught.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.440">Then tall Hektor of the shining helm answered her: 'All these</p>
	<p id="IL.6.441">things are in my mind also, lady; yet I would feel deep shame</p>
	<p id="IL.6.442">before the Trojans, and the Trojan women with trailing garments,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.443">if like a coward I were to shrink aside from the fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.444">and the spirit will not let me, since I have learned to be valiant</p>
	<p id="IL.6.445">and to fight always among the foremost ranks of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.446">winning for my own self great glory, and for my father.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.447">For I know this thing well in my heart, and my mind knows it:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.448">there will come a day when sacred Ilion shall perish,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.449">and Priam, and the people of Priam of the strong ash spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.450">But it is not so much the pain to come of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.6.451">that troubles me, not even of Priam the king nor Hekabe,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.452">not the thought of my brothers who in their numbers and valour</p>
	<p id="IL.6.453">shall drop in the dust under the hands of men who hate them,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.454">as troubles me the thought of you, when some bronze-armoured</p>
	<p id="IL.6.455">Achaian leads you off, taking away your day of liberty,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.456">in tears; and in Argos you must work at the loom of another,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.457">and carry water from the spring Messeis or Hypereia,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.458">all unwilling, but strong will be the necessity upon you;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.459">and some day seeing you shedding tears a man will say of you:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.460">"This is the wife of Hektor, who was ever the bravest fighter</p>
	<p id="IL.6.461">of the Trojans, breakers of horses, in the days when they fought about Ilion."</p>
	<p id="IL.6.462">So will one speak of you; and for you it will be yet a fresh grief,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.463">to be widowed of such a man who could fight off the day of your slavery.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.464">But may I be dead and the piled earth hide me under before I</p>
	<p id="IL.6.465">hear you crying and know by this that they drag you captive.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.466">So speaking glorious Hektor held out his arms to his baby,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.467">who shrank back to his fair-girdled nurse's bosom</p>
	<p id="IL.6.468">screaming, and frightened at the aspect of his own father,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.469">terrified as he saw the bronze and the crest with its horse-hair,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.470">nodding dreadfully, as he thought, from the peak of the helmet.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.471">Then his beloved father laughed out, and his honoured mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.472">and at once glorious Hektor lifted from his head the helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.6.473">and laid it in all its shining upon the ground. Then taking</p>
	<p id="IL.6.474">up his dear son he tossed him about in his arms, and kissed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.475">and lifted his voice in prayer to Zeus and the other immortals:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.476">'Zeus, and you other immortals, grant that this boy, who is my son,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.477">may be as I am, pre-eminent among the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.478">great in strength, as am I, and rule strongly over Ilion;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.479">and some day let them say of him: "He is better by far than his father",</p>
	<p id="IL.6.480">as he comes in from the fighting; and let him kill his enemy</p>
	<p id="IL.6.481">and bring home the blooded spoils, and delight the heart of his mother.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.482">So speaking he set his child again in the arms of his beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.6.483">wife, who took him back again to her fragrant bosom</p>
	<p id="IL.6.484">smiling in her tears; and her husband saw, and took pity upon her,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.485">and stroked her with his hand, and called her by name and spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.486">'Poor Andromache! Why does your heart sorrow so much for me?</p>
	<p id="IL.6.487">No man is going to hurl me to Hades, unless it is fated,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.488">but as for fate, I think that no man yet has escaped it</p>
	<p id="IL.6.489">once it has taken its first form, neither brave man nor coward.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.490">Go therefore back to our house, and take up your own work,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.491">the loom and the distaff, and see to it that your handmaidens</p>
	<p id="IL.6.492">ply their work also; but the men must see to the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.493">all men who are the people of Ilion, but I beyond others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.494">So glorious Hektor spoke and again took up the helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.6.495">with its crest of horse-hair, while his beloved wife went homeward,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.496">turning to look back on the way, letting the live tears fall.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.497">And as she came in speed into the well-settled household</p>
	<p id="IL.6.498">of Hektor the slayer of men, she found numbers of handmaidens</p>
	<p id="IL.6.499">within, and her coming stirred all of them into lamentation.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.500">So they mourned in his house over Hektor while he was living</p>
	<p id="IL.6.501">still, for they thought he would never again come back from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.6.502">alive, escaping the Achaian hands and their violence.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.503">But Paris in turn did not linger long in his high house,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.504">but when he had put on his glorious armour with bronze elaborate</p>
	<p id="IL.6.505">he ran in the confidence of his quick feet through the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.506">As when some stalled horse who has been corn-fed at the manger</p>
	<p id="IL.6.507">breaking free of his rope gallops over the plain in thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.6.508">to his accustomed bathing place in a sweet-running river</p>
	<p id="IL.6.509">and in the pride of his strength holds high his head, and the mane floats</p>
	<p id="IL.6.510">over his shoulders; sure of his glorious strength, the quick knees</p>
	<p id="IL.6.511">carry him to the loved places and the pasture of horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.6.512">so from uttermost Pergamos came Paris, the son of</p>
	<p id="IL.6.513">Priam, shining in all his armour of war as the sun shines,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.514">laughing aloud, and his quick feet carried him; suddenly thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.6.515">he came on brilliant Hektor, his brother, where he yet lingered</p>
	<p id="IL.6.516">before turning away from the place where he had talked with his lady.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.517">It was Alexandros the godlike who first spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.518">'Brother, I fear that I have held back your haste, by being</p>
	<p id="IL.6.519">slow on the way, not coming in time, as you commanded me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.6.520">Then tall Hektor of the shining helm spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.6.521">'Strange man! There is no way that one, giving judgment in fairness,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.522">could dishonour your work in battle, since you are a strong man.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.523">But of your own accord you hang back, unwilling. And my heart</p>
	<p id="IL.6.524">is grieved in its thought, when I hear shameful things spoken about you</p>
	<p id="IL.6.525">by the Trojans, who undergo hard fighting for your sake.</p>
	<p id="IL.6.526">Let us go now; some day hereafter we will make all right</p>
	<p id="IL.6.527">with the immortal gods in the sky, if Zeus ever grant it,</p>
	<p id="IL.6.528">setting up to them in our houses the wine-bowl of liberty</p>
	<p id="IL.6.529">after we have driven out of Troy the strong-greaved Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.1">So speaking Hektor the glorious swept on through the gates,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.2">and with him went Alexandros his brother, both of them minded</p>
	<p id="IL.7.3">in their hearts to do battle and take their part in the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.4">And as to men of the sea in their supplication the god sends</p>
	<p id="IL.7.5">a fair wind, when they are breaking their strength at the smoothed oar-sweeps,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.6">driving over the sea, and their arms are weak with weariness,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.7">so these two appeared to the Trojans, who had longed for them.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.8">Each killed his man: Paris, the son of lord Areïthoös,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.9">Menesthios, who lived in Arne, born to him of the war club</p>
	<p id="IL.7.10">Areïthoös, and to ox-eyed Phylomedousa;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.11">while Hektor with the sharp spear struck Eïoneus, under</p>
	<p id="IL.7.12">the circle of the bronze helm, in the neck, and broke his limbs' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.13">And Glaukos, lord of the Lykian men, the son of Hippolochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.14">struck down with the spear Iphinoös in the strong encounter,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.15">Dexias' son, as he leapt up behind his fast horses, striking him</p>
	<p id="IL.7.16">in the shoulder. He dropped from car to ground, and his limbs' strength was broken.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.17">Now as the goddess grey-eyed Athene was aware of these two</p>
	<p id="IL.7.18">destroying the men of Argos in the strong encounter,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.19">she went down in a flash of speed from the peaks of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.7.20">to sacred Ilion, where Apollo stirred forth to meet her</p>
	<p id="IL.7.21">from his seat on Pergamos, where he planned that the Trojans should conquer.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.22">These two then encountered each other beside the oak tree,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.23">and speaking first the son of Zeus, lord Apollo, addressed her:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.24">'What can be your desire this time, o daughter of great Zeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.25">that you came down from Olympos at the urge of your mighty spirit?</p>
	<p id="IL.7.26">To give the Danaans victory in the battle, turning it</p>
	<p id="IL.7.27">back? Since you have no pity at all for the Trojans who are dying.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.28">But if you might only do as I say, it would be far better.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.29">For this day let us put an end to the hatred and the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.7.30">now; they shall fight again hereafter, till we witness the finish</p>
	<p id="IL.7.31">they make of Ilion, since it is dear to the heart of you, who</p>
	<p id="IL.7.32">are goddesses immortal, that this city shall be made desolate.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.33">Then in answer the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.34">'Worker from afar, thus let it be. These were my thoughts also</p>
	<p id="IL.7.35">as I came down from Olympos among the Achaians and Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.36">Tell me then, how are you minded to stop these men in their fighting?'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.37">Now in turn the son of Zeus, lord Apollo, addressed her:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.38">'Let us rouse up the strong heart in Hektor, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.39">if he might call forth some Danaan to do battle against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.40">single man against single man, in bitter combat;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.41">and let the strong-greaved Achaians, stirred into admiration,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.42">send forth a single man to do battle with brilliant Hektor.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.43">He spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess grey-eyed Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.44">Now Helenos, Priam's beloved son, gathered into his heart their</p>
	<p id="IL.7.45">deliberation, and all that pleased the musing divinities.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.46">He went on his way and stood beside Hektor and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.47">'Hektor, o son of Priam and equal of Zeus in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.48">would you now be persuaded by me, for I am your brother?</p>
	<p id="IL.7.49">Make the rest of the Trojans sit down, and all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.50">and yourself call forth one of the Achaians, their bravest,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.51">to fight man to man against you in bitter combat.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.52">Since it is not your destiny yet to die and encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.7.53">fate. For thus I heard it in the speech of the gods everlasting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.54">So he spoke, and Hektor hearing his word was happy,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.55">and went into the space between and forced back the Trojan battalions,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.56">holding his spear by the middle, until they were all seated,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.57">while Agamemnon in turn seated the strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.58">and Athene and the lord of the silver bow, Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.59">assuming the likenesses of birds, of vultures, settled</p>
	<p id="IL.7.60">aloft the great oak tree of their father, Zeus of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.61">taking their ease and watching these men whose ranks, dense-settled,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.62">shuddered into a bristle of spears, of shields and of helmets.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.63">As when the shudder of the west wind suddenly rising</p>
	<p id="IL.7.64">scatters across the water, and the water darkens beneath it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.65">so darkening were settled the ranks of Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.7.66">in the plain. And now Hektor spoke forth between them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.67">'Listen to me, you Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.68">while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.69">Zeus, son of Kronos, who sits on high, would not bring to fulfilment</p>
	<p id="IL.7.70">our oaths, but is found to be of evil intention toward both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.7.71">until that day when you storm Troy of the strong towers, or that day</p>
	<p id="IL.7.72">when you yourselves are broken beside your seafaring vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.73">Seeing now that among you are the bravest of all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.74">let one of you, whose heart stirs him to combat against me,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.75">stand forth before all to fight by himself against brilliant Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.76">Behold the terms that I make, let Zeus be witness upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.77">If with the thin edge of the bronze he takes my life, then</p>
	<p id="IL.7.78">let him strip my armour and carry it back to the hollow ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.79">but give my body to be taken home again, so that the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.7.80">and the wives of the Trojans may give me in death my rite of burning.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.81">But if I take his life, and Apollo grants me the glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.82">I will strip his armour and carry it to sacred Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.7.83">and hang it in front of the temple of far-striking Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.84">but his corpse I will give back among the strong-benched vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.7.85">so that the flowing-haired Achaians may give him due burial</p>
	<p id="IL.7.86">and heap up a mound upon him beside the broad passage of Helle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.87">And some day one of the men to come will say, as he sees it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.88">one who in his benched ship sails on the wine-blue water:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.89">"This is the mound of a man who died long ago in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.90">who was one of the bravest, and glorious Hektor killed him."</p>
	<p id="IL.7.91">So will he speak some day, and my glory will not be forgotten.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.92">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence</p>
	<p id="IL.7.93">in shame of refusing him, and in fear to take up his challenge.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.94">But now at long last Menelaos stood forth and addressed them</p>
	<p id="IL.7.95">in scorn and reproach, and stirred within the heart to great sorrow:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.96">'Ah me! You brave in words, you women, not men, of Achaia!</p>
	<p id="IL.7.97">This will be a defilement upon us, shame upon shame piled,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.98">if no one of the Danaans goes out to face Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.99">No, may all of you turn to water and earth, all of you</p>
	<p id="IL.7.100">who sit by yourselves with no life in you, utterly dishonoured.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.101">I myself will arm against this man. While above us</p>
	<p id="IL.7.102">the threads of victory are held in the hands of the immortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.103">So he spoke, and began to put on his splendid armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.104">And there, o Menelaos, would have shown forth the end of your life</p>
	<p id="IL.7.105">under the hands of Hektor, since he was far stronger than you were,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.106">had not the kings of the Achaians leapt up and caught you;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.107">and the son of Atreus himself, powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.108">caught you by the right hand, and called you by name, and spoke to you:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.109">'Menelaos, beloved of God, you are mad; you have no need</p>
	<p id="IL.7.110">to take leave of your senses thus. Hold fast, though it hurts you,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.111">nor long in your pride to fight with a man who is better than you are,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.112">with Hektor, Priam's son. There are others who shudder before him.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.113">Even Achilleus, in the fighting where men win glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.114">trembles to meet this man, and he is far better than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.115">Go back now and sit down in the throng of your own companions;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.116">the Achaians will set up another to fight against this man,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.117">and even though he is without fear, and can never be glutted</p>
	<p id="IL.7.118">with rough work, I think he will be glad to leave off, even</p>
	<p id="IL.7.119">if he comes off whole from the hateful fighting and bitter combat.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.120">The hero spoke like this and bent the heart of his brother</p>
	<p id="IL.7.121">since he urged wisely. And Menelaos obeyed him; his henchmen</p>
	<p id="IL.7.122">joyfully thereupon took off the armour from his shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.123">Nestor among the Argives now stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.124">'Oh, for shame. Great sorrow settles on the land of Achaia.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.125">Surely he would groan aloud, Peleus, the aged horseman,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.126">the great man of counsel among the Myrmidons, and their speaker.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.127">Once, as he questioned me in his house, he was filled with great joy</p>
	<p id="IL.7.128">as he heard the generation and blood of all of the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.129">Now if he were to hear how all cringe away before Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.130">many a time he would lift up his very hands to the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.131">and the life breath from his limbs would go down into the house of Hades.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.132">If only, o father Zeus, Athene, Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.133">I were in my youth as when the Pylians assembled</p>
	<p id="IL.7.134">and the spear-fighting Arkadians battled by swirling Keladon,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.135">by the streams of Iardanos and before the ramparts of Pheia.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.136">Their champion stood forth, Ereuthalion, a man godlike,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.137">wearing upon his shoulders the armour of lord Areïthoös,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.138">Areïthoös the brilliant, given by the men of that time</p>
	<p id="IL.7.139">and the fair-girdled women the name club-fighter, because he</p>
	<p id="IL.7.140">went into battle armed neither with the bow nor the long spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.141">but with a great bar clubbed of iron broke the battalions.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.142">Lykourgos killed this man by craft, not strength, for he met him</p>
	<p id="IL.7.143">in the narrow pass of the way, where the iron club served not to parry</p>
	<p id="IL.7.144">destruction, for Lykourgos, too quick with a stab beneath it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.145">pinned him through the middle with the spear, so he went down backward</p>
	<p id="IL.7.146">to the ground; and he stripped the armour brazen Ares had given him</p>
	<p id="IL.7.147">and wore the armour thereafter himself through the grind of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.148">But when Lykourgos was grown an old man in his halls, he gave it</p>
	<p id="IL.7.149">to his beloved henchman, Ereuthalion, to carry.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.150">Wearing this armour he called forth all the bravest to fight him,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.151">but they were all afraid and trembling: none had the courage,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.152">only I, for my hard-enduring heart in its daring</p>
	<p id="IL.7.153">drove me to fight him. I in age was the youngest of all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.154">And I fought with him, and Pallas Athene gave me the glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.155">Of all the men I have killed this was the tallest and strongest.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.156">For he sprawled in his great bulk this way and that way. If only</p>
	<p id="IL.7.157">I were young now, as then, and the strength still steady within me;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.158">Hektor of the glancing helm would soon find his battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.159">But you, now, who are the bravest of all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.160">are not minded with a good will to go against Hektor.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.161">So the old man scolded them, and nine in all stood forth.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.162">Far the first to rise up was the lord of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.163">and rose after him the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.164">and next the two Aiantes rose, their fierce strength upon them,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.165">and after these Idomeneus, and Idomeneus' companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.166">Meriones, a match for the murderous Lord of Battles,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.167">and after these Eurypylos, the glorious son of Euaimon,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.168">and Thoas rose up, Andraimon's son, and brilliant Odysseus.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.169">All of these were willing to fight against brilliant Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.170">Now before them again spoke the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.171">'Let the lot be shaken for all of you, to see who wins it.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.172">He shall be the one to gladden the strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.173">and to be glad within his own heart, if he can come off</p>
	<p id="IL.7.174">whole again from the hateful battle and bitter combat.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.175">So he spoke, and each of them marked a lot as his own one lot.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.176">They threw them in the helmet of Atreus' son, Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.177">and the people, holding up their hands to the gods, prayed to them.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.178">Then would murmur any man, gazing into the wide sky:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.179">'Father Zeus, let Aias win the lot, or else Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.180">Tydeus' son, or the king himself of golden Mykenai.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.181">So they spoke, and Nestor the Gerenian horseman shook the lots,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.182">and a lot leapt from the helmet, that one that they all had wished for,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.183">the lot of Aias; and a herald carrying it all through the great throng</p>
	<p id="IL.7.184">showed it from left to right to the great men of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.185">all of them. Each man knew not the mark, and denied it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.186">but as carrying it all through the great throng he showed it to that one</p>
	<p id="IL.7.187">who had marked it as his, and thrown it in the helmet, glorious Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.188">he held forth his hand, and the herald stood by him, and put the lot in it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.189">and he saw his mark on the lot, and knew it, and his heart was gladdened.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.190">He threw it down on the ground beside his foot, and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.191">'See, friends, the lot is mine, and I myself am made happy</p>
	<p id="IL.7.192">in my heart, since I think I can win over brilliant Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.193">Do this, then: while I put on my armour of fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.194">all of you be praying to the lord Zeus, the son of Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.195">in silence and each to himself, let none of the Trojans hear you;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.196">or openly out loud, since we have nothing to be afraid of</p>
	<p id="IL.7.197">at all, since no man by force will beat me backward unwilling</p>
	<p id="IL.7.198">as he wills, nor by craft either, since I think that the man who was born</p>
	<p id="IL.7.199">and raised in Salamis, myself, is not such a novice.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.200">So he spoke, and they prayed to the lord Zeus, the son of Kronos.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.201">And then would murmur any man, gazing into the wide sky:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.202">'Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.203">grant that Aias win the vaunt of renown and the victory;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.204">but if truly you love Hektor and are careful for him,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.205">give to both of them equal strength, make equal their honour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.206">So they spoke, and meanwhile Aias armed him in shining</p>
	<p id="IL.7.207">bronze. Then when he had girt his body in all its armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.208">he strode on his way, as Ares the war god walks gigantic</p>
	<p id="IL.7.209">going into the fighting of men whom the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.7.210">has driven to fight angrily in heart-perishing hatred.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.211">Such was Aias as he strode gigantic, the wall of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.212">smiling under his threatening brows, with his feet beneath him</p>
	<p id="IL.7.213">taking huge strides forward, and shaking the spear far-shadowing.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.214">And the Argives looking upon him were made glad, while the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.7.215">were taken every man in the knees with trembling and terror,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.216">and for Hektor himself the heart beat hard in his breast, but he could not</p>
	<p id="IL.7.217">any more find means to take flight and shrink back into</p>
	<p id="IL.7.218">the throng of his men, since he in his pride had called him to battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.219">Now Aias came near him, carrying like a wall his shield</p>
	<p id="IL.7.220">of bronze and sevenfold ox-hide which Tychios wrought him with much toil;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.221">Tychios, at home in Hyle, far the best of all workers in leather</p>
	<p id="IL.7.222">who had made him the great gleaming shield of sevenfold ox-hide</p>
	<p id="IL.7.223">from strong bulls, and hammered an eighth fold of bronze upon it.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.224">Telamonian Aias, carrying this to cover</p>
	<p id="IL.7.225">his chest, came near to Hektor and spoke to him in words of menace:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.226">'Hektor, single man against single man you will learn now</p>
	<p id="IL.7.227">for sure what the bravest men are like among the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.7.228">even after Achilleus the lion-hearted who breaks men in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.229">He lies now apart among his own beaked seafaring</p>
	<p id="IL.7.230">ships, in anger at Agamemnon, the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.231">But here are we; and we are such men as can stand up against you;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.232">there are plenty of us; so now begin your fight and your combat.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.233">Tall Hektor of the glancing helm answered him: 'Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.234">son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, o lord of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.235">do not be testing me as if I were some ineffectual</p>
	<p id="IL.7.236">boy, or a woman, who knows nothing of the works of warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.237">I know well myself how to fight and kill men in battle;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.238">I know how to turn to the right, how to turn to the left the ox-hide</p>
	<p id="IL.7.239">tanned into a shield which is my protection in battle;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.240">I know how to storm my way into the struggle of flying horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.241">I know how to tread my measures on the grim floor of the war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.242">Yet great as you are I would not strike you by stealth, watching</p>
	<p id="IL.7.243">for my chance, but openly, so, if perhaps I might hit you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.244">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.245">and struck the sevenfold-ox-hide terrible shield of Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.7.246">in the uttermost bronze, which was the eighth layer upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.247">and the unwearying bronze spearhead shore its way through six folds</p>
	<p id="IL.7.248">but was stopped in the seventh ox-hide. Then after him Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.7.249">the illustrious in turn cast with his spear far-shadowing</p>
	<p id="IL.7.250">and struck the shield of Priam's son on its perfect circle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.251">All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.252">and crashed its way through the intricately worked corselet;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.253">straight ahead by the flank the spearhead shore through his tunic,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.254">yet he bent away to one side and avoided the dark death.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.255">Both now gripping in their hands the long spears pulled them</p>
	<p id="IL.7.256">out, and went at each other like lions who live on raw meat,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.257">or wild boars, whose strength is no light thing. The son of</p>
	<p id="IL.7.258">Priam stabbed then with his spear into the shield's centre,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.259">nor did the bronze point break its way through, but the spearhead bent back.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.260">Now Aias plunging upon him thrust at the shield, and the spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.7.261">passed clean through, and pounded Hektor back in his fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.262">and tore at his neck passing so that the dark blood broke. Yet</p>
	<p id="IL.7.263">even so Hektor of the shining helmet did not stop fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.264">but gave back and in his heavy hand caught up a stone that</p>
	<p id="IL.7.265">lay in the plain, black and rugged and huge. With this</p>
	<p id="IL.7.266">he struck the sevenfold-ox-hide terrible shield of Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.7.267">in the knob of the centre so that the bronze clashed loud about it.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.268">After him Aias in turn lifting a stone far greater</p>
	<p id="IL.7.269">whirled it and threw, leaning into the cast his strength beyond measure,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.270">and the shield broke inward under the stroke of the rock like a millstone,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.271">and Hektor's very knees gave, so that he sprawled backward,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.272">shield beaten upon him, but at once Apollo lifted him upright.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.273">And now they would have been stabbing with their swords at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.274">had not the heralds, messengers of Zeus and of mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.275">come up, one for the bronze-armoured Achaians, one for the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.276">Idaios and Talthybios, both men of good counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.277">They held their staves between the two men, and the herald Idaios</p>
	<p id="IL.7.278">out of his knowledge of prudent advices spoke a word to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.279">'Stop the fight, dear children, nor go on with this battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.280">To Zeus who gathers the clouds both of you are beloved,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.281">and both of you are fighters; this thing all of us know surely.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.282">Night darkens now. It is a good thing to give way to the night-time.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.283">Aias the son of Telamon spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.284">'Bid Hektor answer this, Idaios, since it was he who</p>
	<p id="IL.7.285">in his pride called forth all our bravest to fight him.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.286">Let him speak first; and I for my part shall do as he urges.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.287">Tall Hektor of the glancing helm answered him: 'Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.288">seeing that God has given you strength, stature and wisdom</p>
	<p id="IL.7.289">also, and with the spear you surpass the other Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.290">let us now give over this fighting and hostility</p>
	<p id="IL.7.291">for today; we shall fight again, until the divinity</p>
	<p id="IL.7.292">chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.293">Night darkens now. It is a good thing to give way to the night-time.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.294">Thus you may bring joy to all the Achaians beside their</p>
	<p id="IL.7.295">ships, and above all to those who are your own kindred and company;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.296">and I in the great city of lord Priam will gladden</p>
	<p id="IL.7.297">the Trojans, and the women of Troy with their trailing robes, who</p>
	<p id="IL.7.298">will go before the divine assembly in thanksgiving for my sake.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.299">Come then, let us give each other glorious presents,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.300">so that any of the Achaians or Trojans may say of us:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.301">"These two fought each other in heart-consuming hate, then</p>
	<p id="IL.7.302">joined with each other in close friendship, before they were parted."'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.303">So he spoke, and bringing a sword with nails of silver</p>
	<p id="IL.7.304">gave it to him, together with the sheath and the well-cut sword belt,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.305">and Aias gave a war belt coloured shining with purple.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.306">So separating, Aias went among the Achaian people,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.307">and Hektor went back to the thronging Trojans, who were made happy</p>
	<p id="IL.7.308">when they saw him coming alive and unwounded out of the combat,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.309">escaping the strength and the unconquerable hands of Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.310">and they, who had not hoped to see him alive, escorted him</p>
	<p id="IL.7.311">back to the town. On the other side the strong-greaved Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.7.312">led Aias, happy in his victory, to great Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.313">When these had come to the shelters of the son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.314">Agamemnon the lord of men dedicated an ox among them,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.315">a five-year-old male, to Zeus, all-powerful son of Kronos.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.316">They skinned the victim and put it in order, and butchered the carcass,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.317">and cut up the meat expertly into small pieces, and spitted them,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.318">and roasted all carefully, and took off the pieces.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.319">Then after they had finished the work and got the feast ready,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.320">they feasted, nor was any man's hunger denied a fair portion;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.321">and Atreus' son, the hero wide-ruling Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.322">gave to Aias in honour the long cuts of the chine's portion.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.323">But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.324">the aged man began to weave his counsel before them</p>
	<p id="IL.7.325">first, Nestor, whose advice had shown best before this.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.326">He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.327">'Son of Atreus, and you other great men of all the Achaians:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.328">seeing that many flowing-haired Achaians have died here,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.329">whose dark blood has been scattered beside the fair waters of Skamandros</p>
	<p id="IL.7.330">by the fierce war god, while their souls went down into the house of Hades;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.331">therefore with the dawn we should set a pause to the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.7.332">of Achaians, and assembling them wheel back the bodies</p>
	<p id="IL.7.333">with mules and oxen; then must we burn them a little apart from</p>
	<p id="IL.7.334">the ships, so that each whose duty it is may carry the bones back</p>
	<p id="IL.7.335">to a man's children, when we go home to the land of our fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.336">And let us gather and pile one single mound on the corpse-pyre</p>
	<p id="IL.7.337">indiscriminately from the plain, and build fast upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.7.338">towered ramparts, to be a defence of ourselves and our vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.339">And let us build into these walls gates strongly fitted</p>
	<p id="IL.7.340">that there may be a way through them for the driving of horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.341">and on the outer side, and close, we must dig a deep ditch</p>
	<p id="IL.7.342">circling it, so as to keep off their people and horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.343">that we may not be crushed under the attack of these proud Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.344">So he spoke, and all the kings gave him their approval.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.345">Now there was an assembly of Trojans high on the city of Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.7.346">fiercely shaken to tumult before the doors of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.347">and among these Antenor the thoughtful began to address them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.348">'Trojans and Dardanians and companions in arms: hear me</p>
	<p id="IL.7.349">while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.350">Come then: let us give back Helen of Argos and all her possessions</p>
	<p id="IL.7.351">to the sons of Atreus to take away, seeing now we fight with</p>
	<p id="IL.7.352">our true pledges made into lies; and I see no good thing's</p>
	<p id="IL.7.353">accomplishment for us in the end, unless we do this.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.354">He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them rose up</p>
	<p id="IL.7.355">brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.356">who spoke to him in answer and addressed them in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.357">'Antenor, these things that you argue please me no longer.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.358">Your mind knows how to contrive a saying better than this one.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.359">But if in all seriousness this is your true argument; then</p>
	<p id="IL.7.360">it is the very gods who ruined the brain within you.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.361">I will speak out before the Trojans, breakers of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.362">I refuse, straight out. I will not give back the woman.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.363">But of the possessions I carried away to our house from Argos</p>
	<p id="IL.7.364">I am willing to give all back, and to add to these from my own goods.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.365">He spoke thus and sat down again, and among them rose up</p>
	<p id="IL.7.366">Priam, son of Dardanos, equal of the gods in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.367">who in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.368">'Trojans and Dardanians and companions in arms: hear me</p>
	<p id="IL.7.369">while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.370">Take now your supper about the city, as you did before this,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.371">and remember your duty of the watch, and be each man wakeful;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.372">and at dawn let Idaios go to the hollow ships, and speak with</p>
	<p id="IL.7.373">the sons of Atreus, Menelaos and Agamemnon, giving</p>
	<p id="IL.7.374">the word of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.375">and to add this solid message, and ask them if they are willing</p>
	<p id="IL.7.376">to stop the sorrowful fighting until we can burn the bodies</p>
	<p id="IL.7.377">of our dead. We shall fight again until the divinity</p>
	<p id="IL.7.378">chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.379">So he spoke, and they listened to him with care, and obeyed him;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.380">and so took their supper, watch succeeding watch, through the army.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.381">Then at dawn Idaios went down to the hollow ships, where</p>
	<p id="IL.7.382">he found the Danaans, henchmen of the war god, in assembly</p>
	<p id="IL.7.383">beside the stern of Agamemnon's ship; the herald</p>
	<p id="IL.7.384">with the great voice took his stand in their midst, and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.385">'Son of Atreus, and you other great men of all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.386">Priam and the rest of the haughty Trojans have bidden me</p>
	<p id="IL.7.387">give you, if this message be found to your pleasure and liking,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.388">the word of Alexandros, for whose sake this strife has arisen.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.389">All those possessions that Alexandros carried in his hollow</p>
	<p id="IL.7.390">ships to Troy, and I wish that he had perished before then,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.391">he is willing to give all back, and to add to these from his own goods.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.392">But the very wedded wife of glorious Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.7.393">he says that he will not give, though the Trojans would have him do it.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.394">They told me to give you this message also, if you are willing;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.395">to stop the sorrowful fighting until we can burn the bodies</p>
	<p id="IL.7.396">of our dead. We shall fight again afterwards, until the divinity</p>
	<p id="IL.7.397">chooses between us, and gives victory to one or the other.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.398">So he spoke, and all of them stayed quiet in silence;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.399">but now at long last Diomedes of the great war cry addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.400">'Now let none accept the possessions of Alexandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.401">nor take back Helen; one who is very simple can see it,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.402">that by this time the terms of death hang over the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.403">So he spoke, and all sons of the Achaians shouted</p>
	<p id="IL.7.404">acclaim for the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.405">and now powerful Agamemnon spoke to Idaios:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.406">'Idaios, you hear for yourself the word of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.407">how they are answering you; and such is my pleasure also.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.408">But about the burning of the dead bodies I do not begrudge you;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.409">no, for there is no sparing time for the bodies of the perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.410">once they have died, to give them swiftly the pity of burning.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.411">Let Zeus, high-thundering lord of Hera, witness our pledges.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.412">He spoke, and held up the sceptre in the sight of all the gods. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.7.413">Idaios made his way back once more to sacred Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.414">The Trojans and Dardanians were in session of assembly,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.415">all gathered in one place, awaiting Idaios when he might come</p>
	<p id="IL.7.416">back; and he returned to them and delivered his message</p>
	<p id="IL.7.417">standing there in their midst, and they made their swift preparations,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.418">for two things, some to gather the bodies, and the others firewood;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.419">while the Argives on the other side from their strong-benched vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.7.420">went forward, some to gather the bodies, and others firewood.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.421">Now the sun of a new day struck on the ploughlands, rising</p>
	<p id="IL.7.422">out of the quiet water and the deep stream of the ocean</p>
	<p id="IL.7.423">to climb the sky. The Trojans assembled together. They found</p>
	<p id="IL.7.424">it hard to recognize each individual dead man;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.425">but with water they washed away the blood that was on them</p>
	<p id="IL.7.426">and as they wept warm tears they lifted them on to the wagons.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.427">But great Priam would not let them cry out; and in silence</p>
	<p id="IL.7.428">they piled the bodies upon the pyre, with their hearts in sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.429">and burned them upon the fire, and went back to sacred Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.430">In the same way on the other side the strong-greaved Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.7.431">piled their own slain upon the pyre, with their hearts in sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.432">and burned them upon the fire, and went-back to their hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.433">But when the dawn was not yet, but still the pallor of night's edge,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.434">a chosen body of the Achaians formed by the pyre;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.435">and they gathered together and piled one single mound all above it</p>
	<p id="IL.7.436">indiscriminately from the plain, and built a fort on it</p>
	<p id="IL.7.437">with towered ramparts, to be a defence for themselves and their vessels;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.438">and they built within these walls gates strongly fitted</p>
	<p id="IL.7.439">that there might be a way through them for the driving of horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.440">and on the outer side and against it they dug a deep ditch,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.441">making it great and wide, and fixed the sharp stakes inside it.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.442">So the flowing-haired Achaians laboured, and meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.7.443">the gods in session at the side of Zeus who handles the lightning</p>
	<p id="IL.7.444">watched the huge endeavour of the bronze-armoured Achaians;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.445">and the god Poseidon who shakes the earth began speaking among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.446">'Father Zeus, is there any mortal left on the wide earth</p>
	<p id="IL.7.447">who will still declare to the immortals his mind and his purpose?</p>
	<p id="IL.7.448">Do you not see how now these flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.7.449">have built a wall landward of their ships, and driven about it</p>
	<p id="IL.7.450">a ditch, and not given to the gods any grand sacrifice?</p>
	<p id="IL.7.451">Now the fame of this will last as long as dawnlight is scattered,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.452">and men will forget that wall which I and Phoibos Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.7.453">built with our hard work for the hero Laomedon's city.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.454">Deeply troubled, Zeus who gathers the clouds answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.7.455">'What a thing to have said, earth-shaker of the wide strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.456">Some other one of the gods might fear such a thought, one who</p>
	<p id="IL.7.457">is a god far weaker of his hands and in anger than you are;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.458">but the fame of you shall last as long as dawnlight is scattered.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.459">Come then! After once more the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.7.460">are gone back with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.461">break their wall to pieces and scatter it into the salt sea</p>
	<p id="IL.7.462">and pile again the beach deep under the sands and cover it;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.463">so let the great wall of the Achaians go down to destruction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.7.464">As these two were talking thus together, the sun went</p>
	<p id="IL.7.465">down, and the work of the Achaians was finished. They slaughtered</p>
	<p id="IL.7.466">oxen then beside their shelters, and took their supper.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.467">The ships came over to them from Lemnos bringing them wine, ships</p>
	<p id="IL.7.468">sent over to them in numbers by the son of Jason, Euneos,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.469">whom Hypsipyle had borne to the shepherd of the people, Jason.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.470">Apart to the sons of Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.471">Jason's son had given wine as a gift, a thousand</p>
	<p id="IL.7.472">measures; and thence the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.7.473">bought wine, some for bronze and others for shining iron,</p>
	<p id="IL.7.474">some for skins and some for the whole oxen, while others</p>
	<p id="IL.7.475">paid slaves taken in war; and they made their feasting abundant.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.476">All night long thereafter the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.7.477">feasted, and the Trojans and their companions in arms in the city;</p>
	<p id="IL.7.478">but all night long Zeus of the counsels was threatening evil</p>
	<p id="IL.7.479">upon them in the terrible thunderstroke. Green fear took hold of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.480">They spilled the wine on the ground from their cups, and none was so hardy</p>
	<p id="IL.7.481">as to drink, till he had poured to the all-powerful son of Kronos.</p>
	<p id="IL.7.482">They lay down thereafter and took the blessing of slumber.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.1">Now Dawn the yellow-robed scattered over all the earth. Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.8.2">who joys in the thunder made an assembly of all the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.8.3">upon the highest peak of rugged Olympos. There he</p>
	<p id="IL.8.4">spoke to them himself, and the other divinities listened:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.5">'Hear me, all you gods and all you goddesses: hear me</p>
	<p id="IL.8.6">while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.7">Now let no female divinity, nor male god either,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.8">presume to cut across the way of my word, but consent to it</p>
	<p id="IL.8.9">all of you, so that I can make an end in speed of these matters.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.10">And any one I perceive against the gods' will attempting</p>
	<p id="IL.8.11">to go among the Trojans and help them, or among the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.12">he shall go whipped against his dignity back to Olympos;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.13">or I shall take him and dash him down to the murk of Tartaros,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.14">far below, where the uttermost depth of the pit lies under</p>
	<p id="IL.8.15">earth, where there are gates of iron and a brazen doorstone,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.16">as far beneath the house of Hades as from earth the sky lies.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.17">Then he will see how far I am strongest of all the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.18">Come, you gods, make this endeavour, that you all may learn this.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.19">Let down out of the sky a cord of gold; lay hold of it</p>
	<p id="IL.8.20">all you who are gods and all who are goddesses, yet not</p>
	<p id="IL.8.21">even so can you drag down Zeus from the sky to the ground, not</p>
	<p id="IL.8.22">Zeus the high lord of counsel, though you try until you grow weary.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.23">Yet whenever I might strongly be minded to pull you,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.24">I could drag you up, earth and all and sea and all with you,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.25">then fetch the golden rope about the horn of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.8.26">and make it fast, so that all once more should dangle in mid air.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.27">So much stronger am I than the gods, and stronger than mortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.28">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.29">stunned at his word, for indeed he had spoken to them very strongly.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.30">But now at long last the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.31">'Son of Kronos, our father, o lordliest of the mighty,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.32">we know already your strength and how none can stand up against it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.33">Yet even so we are sorrowful for the Danaan spearmen</p>
	<p id="IL.8.34">who must fill out an unhappy destiny, and perish.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.35">Still we shall keep out of the fighting, as you command us;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.36">yet we will put good counsel in the Argives; if it may help them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.37">so that not all of them will die because of your anger.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.38">Then Zeus the gatherer of the clouds smiled at her and answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.39">'Tritogeneia, dear daughter, do not lose heart; for I say this</p>
	<p id="IL.8.40">not in outright anger, and my meaning toward you is kindly.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.41">He spoke, and under the chariot harnessed his bronze-shod horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.42">flying-footed, with long manes streaming of gold; and he put on</p>
	<p id="IL.8.43">clothing of gold about his own body, and took up the golden</p>
	<p id="IL.8.44">lash, carefully compacted, and climbed up into his chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.45">and whipped them into a run, and they winged their way unreluctant</p>
	<p id="IL.8.46">through the space between the earth and the starry heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.47">He came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.48">to Gargaron, where was his holy ground and his smoking altar.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.49">There the father of gods and of mortals halted his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.50">and slipped them from their harness, and drifted close mist about them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.51">and himself rejoicing in the pride of his strength sat down on the mountain</p>
	<p id="IL.8.52">looking out over the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.53">Now the flowing-haired Achaians had taken their dinner</p>
	<p id="IL.8.54">lightly among their shelters, and they put on their armour thereafter;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.55">and on the other side, in the city, the Trojans took up</p>
	<p id="IL.8.56">their armour, fewer men, yet minded to stand the encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.8.57">even so, caught in necessity, for their wives and their children.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.58">And all the gates were made open, and the fighting men swept through them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.59">the foot ranks and the horsemen, and the sound grew huge of their onset.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.60">Now as these advancing came to one place and encountered,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.61">they dashed their shields together and their spears, and the strength of</p>
	<p id="IL.8.62">armoured men in bronze, and the shields massive in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.8.63">clashed against each other, and the sound grew huge of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.64">There the screaming and the shouts of triumph rose up together</p>
	<p id="IL.8.65">of men killing and men killed, and the ground ran blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.66">So long as it was early morning and the sacred daylight increasing,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.67">so long the thrown weapons of both took hold and men dropped under them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.68">But when the sun god stood bestriding the middle heaven,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.69">then the father balanced his golden scales, and in them</p>
	<p id="IL.8.70">he set two fateful portions of death, which lays men prostrate,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.71">for Trojans, breakers of horses, and bronze-armoured Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.72">and balanced it by the middle. The Achaians' death-day was heaviest.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.73">There the fates of the Achaians settled down toward the bountiful</p>
	<p id="IL.8.74">earth, while those of the Trojans were lifted into the wide sky;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.75">and he himself crashed a great stroke from Ida, and a kindling</p>
	<p id="IL.8.76">flash shot over the people of the Achaians; seeing it</p>
	<p id="IL.8.77">they were stunned, and pale terror took hold of all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.78">Then Idomeneus dared not stand his ground, nor Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.79">nor did the two Aiantes stand, the henchmen of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.80">only Gerenian Nestor stayed, the Achaians' watcher;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.81">not that he would, but his horse was failing, struck by an arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.8.82">from brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.83">struck at the point of the head, where the utmost hairs of horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.84">are grown along the skull, and which is a place most mortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.85">He reared up in agony as the shaft went into the brain, then</p>
	<p id="IL.8.86">threw the team into confusion writhing upon the bronze point.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.87">Now as the old man hewed away the horse's trace-harness</p>
	<p id="IL.8.88">with a quick sword-cut, meanwhile the fast-running horses of Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.89">came through the flux of the fighting and carried their daring driver,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.90">Hektor; and now the old man would have lost his life there, had not</p>
	<p id="IL.8.91">Diomedes of the great war cry sharply perceived him.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.92">He cried out in a terrible voice to rally Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.93">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.94">where are you running, turning your back in battle like a coward?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.95">Do not let them strike the spear in your back as you run for it,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.96">but stay, so that we can beat back this fierce man from the ancient.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.97">He spoke, but long-suffering great Odysseus gave no attention</p>
	<p id="IL.8.98">as he swept by on his way to the hollow ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.99">The son of Tydeus, alone as he was, went among the champions</p>
	<p id="IL.8.100">and stood before the horses of the old man, the son of Neleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.101">and uttering his winged words he addressed him: 'Old sir,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.102">in very truth these young fighters are too much for you,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.103">and all your strength is gone, and hard old age is upon you,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.104">your henchman is a man of no worth, and your horses are heavy.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.105">Come then, climb into my chariot, so that you may see</p>
	<p id="IL.8.106">what the Trojan horses are like, how they understand their</p>
	<p id="IL.8.107">plain, and how to traverse it in rapid pursuit and withdrawal;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.108">horses I took away from Aineias, who strikes men to terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.109">Let the henchmen look after your horses now, while we two</p>
	<p id="IL.8.110">steer these against the Trojans, breakers of horses, so Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.111">even may know if my spear also rages in my hands' grip.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.112">He spoke, and Nestor the Gerenian horseman obeyed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.113">Thereon the two strong henchmen, Sthenelos and the courtly</p>
	<p id="IL.8.114">Eurymedon, looked after the horses of Nestor. The others</p>
	<p id="IL.8.115">both together mounted the chariot of Diomedes.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.116">Nestor in his hands took up the glittering reins, then</p>
	<p id="IL.8.117">lashed the horses on, and soon they were close to Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.118">and as he raged straight forward the son of Tydeus threw at him</p>
	<p id="IL.8.119">and missed his man, but struck the charioteer, his henchman,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.120">Eniopeus, the son of high-hearted Thebaios, striking him</p>
	<p id="IL.8.121">in the chest next to the nipple as he gripped the reins of his horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.122">He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.123">shied away. And there his life and his strength were scattered.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.124">And bitter sorrow closed over Hektor's heart for his driver,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.125">yet grieving as he did for his friend he left him to lie there,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.126">and went on after another bold charioteer; and it was not</p>
	<p id="IL.8.127">long that the horses went lacking a driver, since soon he found one,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.128">Archeptolemos, bold son of Iphitos, and gave into his hands</p>
	<p id="IL.8.129">the reins, and mounted him behind the fast-running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.130">And now there would have been fighting beyond control, and destruction,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.131">now they would have been driven and penned like sheep against Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.132">had not the father of gods and of men sharply perceived them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.133">He thundered horribly and let loose the shimmering lightning</p>
	<p id="IL.8.134">and dashed it to the ground in front of the horses of Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.8.135">and a ghastly blaze of flaming sulphur shot up, and the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.136">terrified both cringed away against the chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.137">And the glittering reins escaped out of the hands of Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.138">and he was afraid in his heart and called out to Diomedes:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.139">'Son of Tydeus, steer now to flight your single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.140">Can you not see that the power of Zeus no longer is with you?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.141">For the time Zeus, son of Kronos, gives glory to this man;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.142">for today; hereafter, if he will, he will give it</p>
	<p id="IL.8.143">to us also; no man can beat back the purpose of Zeus, not</p>
	<p id="IL.8.144">even one very strong, since Zeus is by far the greater.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.145">Then in turn Diomedes of the great war cry answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.146">'Yes, old sir, all this you have said is fair and orderly.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.147">But this thought comes as a bitter sorrow to my heart and my spirit;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.148">for some day Hektor will say openly before the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.149">"The son of Tydeus, running before me, fled to his vessels."</p>
	<p id="IL.8.150">So he will vaunt; and then let the wide earth open beneath me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.151">Nestor the Gerenian horseman spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.152">'Ah me, son of brave Tydeus; what a thing to have spoken.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.153">If Hektor calls you a coward and a man of no strength, then</p>
	<p id="IL.8.154">the Trojans and Dardanians will never believe him,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.155">nor will the wives of the high-hearted Trojan warriors,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.156">they whose husbands you hurled in the dust in the pride of their manhood.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.157">So he spoke, and turned to flight the single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.158">back again into the rout; and now the Trojans and Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.159">with unearthly clamour showered their baneful missiles upon them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.160">and tall Hektor of the shining helm called out in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.161">'Son of Tydeus, beyond others the fast-mounted Danaans honoured you</p>
	<p id="IL.8.162">with pride of place, the choice meats and the filled wine-cups.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.163">But now they will disgrace you, who are no better than a woman.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.164">Down with you, you poor doll. You shall not storm our battlements</p>
	<p id="IL.8.165">with me giving way before you, you shall not carry our women</p>
	<p id="IL.8.166">home in your ships; before that comes I will give you your destiny.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.167">He spoke, and the son of Tydeus pondered doubtfully, whether</p>
	<p id="IL.8.168">to turn his horses about and match his strength against Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.169">Three times in his heart and spirit he pondered turning,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.170">and three times from the hills of Ida Zeus of the counsels</p>
	<p id="IL.8.171">thundered, giving a sign to the Trojans that the battle was turning.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.172">But Hektor called afar in a great voice to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.173">'Trojans, Lykians and Dardanians who fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.174">be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.175">I see that the son of Kronos has bowed his head and assented</p>
	<p id="IL.8.176">to my high glory and success, but granted the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.8.177">disaster: fools, who designed with care these fortifications,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.178">flimsy things, not worth a thought, which will not beat my strength</p>
	<p id="IL.8.179">back, but lightly my horses will leap the ditch they have dug them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.180">But after I have come beside their hollow ships, let there</p>
	<p id="IL.8.181">be some who will remember to bring me ravening fire,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.182">so that I can set their ships on fire, and cut down</p>
	<p id="IL.8.183">the very Argives mazed in the smoke at the side of their vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.184">So he spoke, and called aloud to his horses, and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.185">'Xanthos and you, Podargos, Aithon and Lampos the shining,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.186">now repay me for all that loving care in abundance</p>
	<p id="IL.8.187">Andromache the daughter of high-hearted Eëtion</p>
	<p id="IL.8.188">gave you: the sweet-hearted wheat before all the others</p>
	<p id="IL.8.189">and mixed wine with it for you to drink, when her heart inclined to it,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.190">as for me, who am proud that I am her young husband.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.191">Follow close now and be rapid, so we may capture</p>
	<p id="IL.8.192">the shield of Nestor, whose high fame goes up to the sky now,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.193">how it is all of gold, the shield itself and the cross-rods;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.194">and strip from the shoulders of Diomedes, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.195">that elaborate corselet that Hephaistos wrought with much toil.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.196">Could we capture these two things, I might hope the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.8.197">might embark this very night on their fast-running vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.198">So he spoke, boasting, and the lady Hera was angry,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.199">and started upon her throne, and tall Olympos was shaken,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.200">and she spoke straight out to the great god Poseidon:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.201">'For shame, now, far-powerful shaker of the earth. In your breast</p>
	<p id="IL.8.202">the heart takes no sorrow for the Danaans who are dying,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.203">they who at Helike and at Aigai bring you offerings</p>
	<p id="IL.8.204">numerous and delightful. Do you then plan that they conquer.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.205">For if all of us who stand by the Danaans only were willing</p>
	<p id="IL.8.206">to hurl back the Trojans and hold off Zeus of the broad brows,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.207">he would be desperate, there where he sits by himself on Ida.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.208">Deeply troubled, the powerful shaker of the earth answered her</p>
	<p id="IL.8.209">'Hera, reckless of word, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.210">I would not be willing that all the rest of us fight with</p>
	<p id="IL.8.211">Zeus, the son of Kronos, since he is so much the greater.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.212">Now as these two were talking thus to each other, meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.8.213">for those others, all that space which the ditch of the wall held</p>
	<p id="IL.8.214">off from the ships was filled with armoured men and with horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.215">penned there; and he who penned them was a man like the rapid war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.216">Hektor, Priam's son, since Zeus was giving him glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.217">And now he might have kindled their balanced ships with the hot flame,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.218">had not the lady Hera set it in Agamemnon's</p>
	<p id="IL.8.219">heart to rush in with speed himself and stir the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.220">He went on his way beside the Achaians' ships and their shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.8.221">holding up in his heavy hand the great coloured mantle,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.222">and stood beside the black huge-hollowed ship of Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.223">which lay in the midmost, so that he could call out to both sides,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.224">either toward the shelters of Telamonian Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.225">or toward Achilleus, since these two had drawn their balanced ships up</p>
	<p id="IL.8.226">at the utter ends, sure of the strength of their hands and their courage.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.227">He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Danaans:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.228">'Shame, you Argives, poor nonentities splendid to look on.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.229">Where are our high words gone, when we said that we were the bravest?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.230">those words you spoke before all in hollow vaunting at Lemnos</p>
	<p id="IL.8.231">when you were filled with abundant meat of the high-horned oxen</p>
	<p id="IL.8.232">and drank from the great bowls filled to the brim with wine, how each man</p>
	<p id="IL.8.233">could stand up against a hundred or even two hundred Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.8.234">in the fighting; now we together cannot match one of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.235">Hektor, who must presently kindle our ships with the hot fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.236">Father Zeus, is it one of our too strong kings you have stricken</p>
	<p id="IL.8.237">in this disaster now, and stripped him of his high honour?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.238">For I say that never did I pass by your fair-wrought altar</p>
	<p id="IL.8.239">in my benched ships when I came here on this desperate journey;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.240">but on all altars I burned the fat and the thighs of oxen</p>
	<p id="IL.8.241">in my desire to sack the strong-walled city of the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.242">Still, Zeus, bring to pass at least this thing that I pray for.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.243">Let our men at least get clear and escape, and let not</p>
	<p id="IL.8.244">the Achaians be thus beaten down at the hands of the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.245">He spoke thus, and as he wept the father took pity upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.8.246">and bent his head, that the people should stay alive, and not perish.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.247">Straightway he sent down the most lordly of birds, an eagle,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.248">with a fawn, the young of the running deer, caught in his talons,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.249">who cast down the fawn beside Zeus' splendid altar</p>
	<p id="IL.8.250">where the Achaians wrought their devotions to Zeus of the Voices.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.251">They, when they saw the bird and knew it was Zeus who sent it,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.252">remembered once again their warcraft, and turned on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.253">Then, many as the Danaans were, there was no man among them</p>
	<p id="IL.8.254">could claim he held his fast horses ahead of the son of Tydeus</p>
	<p id="IL.8.255">to drive them once more across the ditch and fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.256">but he was far the first to kill a chief man of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.257">Phradmon's son, Agelaos, as he turned his team to escape him.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.258">For in his back even as he was turning the spear fixed</p>
	<p id="IL.8.259">between the shoulders and was driven on through the chest beyond it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.260">He fell from the chariot, and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.261">After him came the Atreidai, Menelaos and Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.262">and the two Aiantes gathering their fierce strength about them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.263">and with them Idomeneus and Idomeneus' companion</p>
	<p id="IL.8.264">Meriones, a match for the murderous lord of battles,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.265">and after these Eurypylos, the glorious son of Euaimon;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.266">and ninth came Teukros, bending into position the curved bow,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.267">and took his place in the shelter of Telamonian Aias'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.268">shield, as Aias lifted the shield to take him. The hero</p>
	<p id="IL.8.269">would watch, whenever in the throng he had struck some man with an arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.270">and as the man dropped and died where he was stricken, the archer</p>
	<p id="IL.8.271">would run back again, like a child to the arms of his mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.272">to Aias, who would hide him in the glittering shield's protection.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.273">Then which of the Trojans first did Teukros the blameless strike down?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.274">Orsilochos first of all, and Ormenos, and Ophelestes,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.275">Daitor and Chromios, and Lykophontes the godlike,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.276">and Amopaon, Polyaimon's son, and Melanippos.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.277">All these he felled to the bountiful earth in close succession.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.278">Agamemnon the lord of men was glad as he watched him</p>
	<p id="IL.8.279">laying waste from the strong bow the Trojan battalions;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.280">he went over and stood beside him and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.281">'Telamonian Teukros, dear heart, o lord of your people,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.282">strike so; thus you may be a light given to the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.283">and to Telamon your father, who cherished you when you were little,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.284">and, bastard as you were, looked after you in his own house.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.285">Bring him into glory, though he is far away; and for my part,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.286">I will tell you this, and it will be a thing accomplished:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.287">if ever Zeus who holds the aegis and Athene grant me</p>
	<p id="IL.8.288">to sack outright the strong-founded citadel of Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.289">first after myself I will put into your hands some great gift</p>
	<p id="IL.8.290">of honour; a tripod, or two horses and the chariot with them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.291">or else a woman, who will go up into the same bed with you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.292">Then in answer to him again spoke Teukros the blameless:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.293">'Son of Atreus, most lordly: must you then drive me, who am eager</p>
	<p id="IL.8.294">myself, as it is? Never, so far as the strength is in me,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.295">have I stopped, since we began driving the Trojans back upon Ilion;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.296">since then I have been lurking here with my bow, to strike down</p>
	<p id="IL.8.297">fighters. And by this I have shot eight long-flanged arrows,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.298">and all of them were driven into the bodies of young men,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.299">fighters; yet still I am not able to hit this mad dog.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.300">He spoke, and let fly another shaft from the bowstring,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.301">straight for Hektor, and all his heart was straining to hit him;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.302">but missed his man, and struck down instead a strong son of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.303">Gorgythion the blameless, hit in the chest by an arrow;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.304">Gorgythion whose mother was lovely Kastianeira,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.305">Priam's bride from Aisyme, with the form of a goddess.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.306">He bent drooping his head to one side, as a garden poppy</p>
	<p id="IL.8.307">bends beneath the weight of its yield and the rains of springtime;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.308">so his head bent slack to one side beneath the helm's weight.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.309">But Teukros now let fly another shaft from the bowstring,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.310">straight for Hektor, and all his heart was straining to hit him,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.311">yet missed his man once again as Apollo faltered his arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.312">and struck Archeptolemos, bold charioteer of Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.313">in the chest next to the nipple as he charged into the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.314">He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.315">shied away. And there his life and his strength were scattered.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.316">And bitter sorrow closed over Hektor's heart for his driver,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.317">yet grieving as he did for his friend he left him to lie there,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.318">and called to his brother Kebriones who stood near to take up</p>
	<p id="IL.8.319">the reins of the horses, nor did he disobey him. But Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.320">himself vaulted down to the ground from the shining chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.8.321">crying a terrible cry and in his hand caught up a great stone,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.322">and went straight for Teukros, heart urgent to hit him. Now Teukros</p>
	<p id="IL.8.323">had drawn a bitter arrow out of his quiver, and laid it</p>
	<p id="IL.8.324">along the bowstring, but as he drew the shaft by his shoulder,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.325">there where between neck and chest the collar-bone interposes,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.326">and this is a spot most mortal; in this place shining-helmed Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.327">struck him in all his fury with the jagged boulder, smashing</p>
	<p id="IL.8.328">the sinew, and all his arm at the wrist was deadened.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.329">He dropped to one knee and stayed, and the bow fell from his hand. Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.8.330">was not forgetful of his fallen brother, but running</p>
	<p id="IL.8.331">stood bestriding him and covered him under the great shield.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.332">Thereon Mekisteus, son of Echios, and brilliant Alastor,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.333">two staunch companions, stooping beneath it, caught up Teukros</p>
	<p id="IL.8.334">and carried him, groaning heavily, to the hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.335">Now once again the Olympian filled the Trojans with fury</p>
	<p id="IL.8.336">and they piled the Achaians straight backward against the deep ditch,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.337">as Hektor ranged in their foremost ranks in the pride of his great strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.338">As when some hunting hound in the speed of his feet pursuing</p>
	<p id="IL.8.339">a wild boar or a lion snaps from behind at his quarters</p>
	<p id="IL.8.340">or flanks, but watches for the beast to turn upon him, so Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.341">followed close on the heels of the flowing-haired Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.342">killing ever the last of the men; and they fled in terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.343">But after they had crossed back over the ditch and the sharp stakes</p>
	<p id="IL.8.344">in flight, and many had gone down under the hands of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.345">they reined in and stood fast again beside their ships, calling</p>
	<p id="IL.8.346">aloud upon each other, and to all of the gods uplifting</p>
	<p id="IL.8.347">their hands each man of them cried out his prayers in a great voice,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.348">while Hektor, wearing the stark eyes of a Gorgon, or murderous</p>
	<p id="IL.8.349">Ares, wheeled about at the edge his bright-maned horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.350">Now seeing them the goddess of the white arms, Hera, took pity</p>
	<p id="IL.8.351">and immediately she spoke to Pallas Athene her winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.352">'For shame, daughter of Zeus who wears the aegis! no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.8.353">shall we care for the Danaans in their uttermost hour of destruction?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.354">These must then fill out an evil destiny, and perish</p>
	<p id="IL.8.355">in the wind of one man's fury where none can stand now against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.356">Hektor, Priam's son, who has wrought so much evil already.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.357">Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.358">'Yet even this man would have his life and strength taken from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.359">dying under the hands of the Argives in his own country;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.360">but it is my father who is so furious in his heart of evil.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.361">He is hard, and forever wicked; he crosses my high hopes,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.362">nor remembers at all those many times I rescued his own son,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.363">Herakles, when the tasks of Eurystheus were too much for his strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.364">And time and again he would cry out aloud to the heavens,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.365">and Zeus would send me down in speed from the sky to help him.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.366">If in the wiliness of my heart I had had thoughts like his,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.367">when Herakles was sent down to Hades of the Gates, to hale back</p>
	<p id="IL.8.368">from the Kingdom of the Dark the hound of the grisly death god,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.369">never would he have got clear of the steep-dripping Stygian water.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.370">Yet now Zeus hates me, and is bent to the wishes of Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.8.371">who kissed his knees and stroked his chin in her hand, and entreated</p>
	<p id="IL.8.372">that he give honour to Achilleus, the sacker of cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.373">Yet time shall be when he calls me again his dear girl of the grey eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.374">So then: do you put under their harness our single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.8.375">while I go back into the house of Zeus, the lord of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.376">and arm me in my weapons of war. So shall I discover</p>
	<p id="IL.8.377">whether the son of Priam, Hektor of the shining helmet,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.378">will feel joy to see us apparent on the outworks of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.379">or see if some Trojan give the dogs and the birds their desire</p>
	<p id="IL.8.380">with fat and flesh, struck down beside the ships of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.381">She spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess Hera of the white arms.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.382">And she, Hera, exalted goddess, daughter of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.8.383">the mighty, went away to harness the gold-bridled horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.384">Now in turn Athene, daughter of Zeus of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.385">beside the threshold of her father slipped off her elaborate</p>
	<p id="IL.8.386">dress which she herself had wrought with her hands' patience,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.387">and now assuming the war tunic of Zeus who gathers</p>
	<p id="IL.8.388">the clouds, she armed herself in her gear for the dismal fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.389">She set her feet in the blazing chariot, and took up a spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.390">heavy, huge, thick, wherewith she beats down the battalions of fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.8.391">men, against whom she of the mighty father is angered.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.392">Hera laid the lash swiftly on the horses; and moving</p>
	<p id="IL.8.393">of themselves groaned the gates of the sky that the Hours guarded,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.394">those Hours to whose charge is given the huge sky and Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.8.395">to open up the dense darkness or again to close it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.396">Through the way between they held the speed of their goaded horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.397">But Zeus father, watching from Ida, was angered terribly</p>
	<p id="IL.8.398">and stirred Iris of the golden wings to run with his message:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.399">'Go forth, Iris the swift, turn them back again, let them not reach me,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.400">since we would close in fighting thus that would be unseemly.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.401">For I will say this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.402">I will lame beneath the harness their fast-running horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.403">and hurl the gods from the driver's place, and smash their chariot;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.404">and not in the circle of ten returning years shall they be whole</p>
	<p id="IL.8.405">of the wounds where the stroke of the lightning hits them; so that</p>
	<p id="IL.8.406">the grey-eyed goddess may know when it is her father she fights with.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.407">Yet with Hera I am not so angry, neither indignant,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.408">since it is ever her way to cross the commands that I give her.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.409">He spoke, and Iris, storm-footed, rose with his message</p>
	<p id="IL.8.410">and took her way from the peaks of Ida to tall Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.411">and at the utmost gates of many-folded Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.8.412">met and stayed them, and spoke the word that Zeus had given her:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.413">'Where so furious? How can your hearts so storm within you?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.414">The son of Kronos will not let you stand by the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.415">Since Zeus has uttered this threat and will make it a thing accomplished:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.416">that he will lame beneath the harness your fast-running horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.417">and hurl yourselves from the driver's place, and smash your chariot;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.418">and not in the circle of ten returning years would you be whole</p>
	<p id="IL.8.419">of the wounds where the stroke of the lightning hits you; so that</p>
	<p id="IL.8.420">you may know, grey-eyed goddess, when it is your father you fight with.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.421">Yes, you, bold brazen wench, are audacious indeed, if truly</p>
	<p id="IL.8.422">you dare to lift up your gigantic spear in the face of your father.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.423">Yet with Hera he is not so angry, neither indignant,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.424">since it is ever her way to cross the commands he gives her.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.425">So Iris the swift-footed spoke and went away from them,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.426">and now Hera spoke a word to Pallas Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.427">'Alas, daughter of Zeus of the aegis: I can no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.8.428">let us fight in the face of Zeus for the sake of mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.429">Let one of them perish then, let another live, as their fortune</p>
	<p id="IL.8.430">wills; let him, as is his right and as his heart pleases,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.431">work out whatever decrees he will on Danaans and Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.432">So she spoke, and turned back again her single-foot horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.433">and the Hours set free their flowing-maned horses from the harness,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.434">and tethered them at their mangers that were piled with ambrosia</p>
	<p id="IL.8.435">and leaned the chariot against the shining inward wall. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.8.436">the goddesses themselves took their place on the golden couches</p>
	<p id="IL.8.437">among the other immortals, their hearts deep grieving within them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.438">Now father Zeus steered back from Ida his strong-wheeled chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.8.439">and horses to Olympos, and came among the gods' sessions,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.440">while for him the famed shaker of the earth set free his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.441">and put the chariot on its stand, with a cloth spread over it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.442">Then Zeus himself of the wide brows took his place on the golden</p>
	<p id="IL.8.443">throne, as underneath his feet tall Olympos was shaken.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.444">These two alone, Hera and Athene, stayed seated apart aside</p>
	<p id="IL.8.445">from Zeus, and would not speak to him, nor ask him a question;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.446">but he knew the whole matter within his heart, and spoke to them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.447">'Why then are you two sorrowful, Athene and Hera?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.448">Surely in the battle where men win glory you were not wearied</p>
	<p id="IL.8.449">out, destroying those Trojans on whom you have set your grim wrath.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.450">In the whole account, such is my strength and my hand so invincible,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.451">not all the gods who are on Olympos could turn me backward,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.452">but before this the trembling took hold of your shining bodies,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.453">before you could look upon the fighting and war's work of sorrow;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.454">for I will say straight out, and it would now be a thing accomplished:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.455">once hit in your car by the lightning stroke you could never</p>
	<p id="IL.8.456">have come back to Olympos, where is the place of the immortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.457">So he spoke; and Athene and Hera muttered, since they were</p>
	<p id="IL.8.458">sitting close to each other, devising evil for the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.459">Still Athene stayed silent and said nothing, but only</p>
	<p id="IL.8.460">sulked at Zeus her father, and savage anger took hold of her.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.461">But the heart of Hera could not contain her anger, and she spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.462">'Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.8.463">We know well already your strength, how it is no small thing.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.464">Yet even so we are sorrowful for the Danaan spearmen</p>
	<p id="IL.8.465">who must fill out an unhappy destiny, and perish.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.466">Still we shall keep out of the fighting, as you command us;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.467">yet we will put good counsel in the Argives, if it may help them;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.468">so that not all of them will die because of your anger.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.469">Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to her again in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.470">'Tomorrow at the dawning, lady Hera of the ox eyes,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.471">you will see, if you have the heart, a still mightier son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.8.472">perishing the ranged numbers of Argive spearmen.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.473">For Hektor the huge will not sooner be stayed from his fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.8.474">until there stirs by the ships the swift-footed son of Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.8.475">on that day when they shall fight by the sterns of the beached ships</p>
	<p id="IL.8.476">in the narrow place of necessity over fallen Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.477">This is the way it is fated to be; and for you and your anger</p>
	<p id="IL.8.478">I care not; not if you stray apart to the undermost limits</p>
	<p id="IL.8.479">of earth and sea, where Iapetos and Kronos seated</p>
	<p id="IL.8.480">have no shining of the sun god Hyperion to delight them</p>
	<p id="IL.8.481">nor winds' delight, but Tartaros stands deeply about them;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.482">not even if you reach that place in your wandering shall I</p>
	<p id="IL.8.483">care for your sulks; since there is nothing more shameless than you are.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.484">So he spoke, and Hera of the white arms gave him no answer.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.485">And now the shining light of the sun was dipped in the Ocean</p>
	<p id="IL.8.486">trailing black night across the grain-giving land. For the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.8.487">the daylight sank against their will, but for the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.8.488">sweet and thrice-supplicated was the coming on of the dark night.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.489">Now glorious Hektor held an assembly of all the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.490">taking them aside from the ships, by a swirling river</p>
	<p id="IL.8.491">on clean ground, where there showed a space not cumbered with corpses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.492">They stepped to the ground from behind their horses and listened to Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.8.493">the loved of Zeus, and the words he spoke to them. He in his hand held</p>
	<p id="IL.8.494">the eleven-cubit-long spear, whose shaft was tipped with a shining</p>
	<p id="IL.8.495">bronze spearhead, and a ring of gold was hooped to hold it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.496">Leaning upon this spear he spoke his words to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.8.497">'Trojans and Dardanians and companions in arms: hear me.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.498">Now I had thought that, destroying the ships and all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.499">we might take our way back once more to windy Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.500">but the darkness came too soon, and this beyond all else rescued</p>
	<p id="IL.8.501">the Argives and their vessels along the beach where the sea breaks.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.502">But now let us give way to black night's persuasion; let us</p>
	<p id="IL.8.503">make ready our evening meal, and as for your flowing-maned horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.504">set them free from their harness, and cast down fodder before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.505">And lead forth also out of the city oxen and fat sheep</p>
	<p id="IL.8.506">in all speed, and convey out also the kindly sweet wine</p>
	<p id="IL.8.507">with food out of our houses. And heap many piles of firewood,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.508">so that all night long and until the young dawn appears</p>
	<p id="IL.8.509">we may burn many fires, and the glare go up into heaven;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.510">so that not in the night-time the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.8.511">may set out to run for home over the sea's wide ridges.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.512">No: not thus in their own good time must they take to their vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.513">but in such a way that a man of them at home will still nurse</p>
	<p id="IL.8.514">his wound, the place where he has been hit with an arrow or sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.8.515">springing to his ship; so that another may shrink hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.8.516">from bringing down fearful war on the Trojans, breakers of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.517">And let the heralds Zeus loves give orders about the city</p>
	<p id="IL.8.518">for the boys who are in their first youth and the grey-browed elders</p>
	<p id="IL.8.519">to take stations on the god-founded bastions that circle the city;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.520">and as for the women, have our wives, each one in her own house,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.521">kindle a great fire; let there be a watch kept steadily</p>
	<p id="IL.8.522">lest a sudden attack get into the town when the fighters have left it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.523">Let it be thus, high-hearted men of Troy, as I tell you.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.524">Let that word that has been spoken now be a strong one,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.525">with that which I speak at dawn to the Trojans, breakers of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.526">For in good hope I pray to Zeus and the other immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.8.527">that we may drive from our place these dogs swept into destruction</p>
	<p id="IL.8.528">whom the spirits of death have carried here on their black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.529">Now for the night we shall keep watch on ourselves, and tomorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.8.530">early, before dawn shows, shall arm ourselves in our weapons</p>
	<p id="IL.8.531">and beside their hollow vessels waken the bitter war god;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.532">and I shall know if the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.533">will force me back from the ships against the wall, or whether I</p>
	<p id="IL.8.534">shall cut him down with the bronze and take home the blooded war-spoils.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.535">Tomorrow he will learn his own strength, if he can stand up to</p>
	<p id="IL.8.536">my spear's advance; but sooner than this, I think, in the foremost</p>
	<p id="IL.8.537">he will go down under the stroke, and many companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.8.538">as the sun goes up into tomorrow. Oh, if I only</p>
	<p id="IL.8.539">could be as this in all my days immortal and ageless</p>
	<p id="IL.8.540">and be held in honour as Athene and Apollo are honoured</p>
	<p id="IL.8.541">as surely as this oncoming day brings evil to the Argives.'</p>
	<p id="IL.8.542">So Hektor spoke among them, and the Trojans shouted approval.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.543">And they set free their sweating horses from under the harness</p>
	<p id="IL.8.544">and tethered them by the reins, each one by his own chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.545">They led forth also out of the city oxen and fat sheep</p>
	<p id="IL.8.546">in all speed, and conveyed out also the kindly sweet wine,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.547">with food out of their houses, and heaped many piles of firewood.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.548">They accomplished likewise full sacrifices before the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.549">and the winds wafted the savour aloft from the plain to the heavens</p>
	<p id="IL.8.550">in its fragrance; and yet the blessed gods took no part of it.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.551">They would not; so hateful to them was sacred Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.552">and Priam, and the city of Priam of the strong ash spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.553">So with hearts made high these sat night-long by the outworks</p>
	<p id="IL.8.554">of battle, and their watchfires blazed numerous about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.555">As when in the sky the stars about the moon's shining</p>
	<p id="IL.8.556">are seen in all their glory, when the air has fallen to stillness,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.557">and all the high places of the hills are clear, and the shoulders out-jutting,</p>
	<p id="IL.8.558">and the deep ravines, as endless bright air spills from the heavens</p>
	<p id="IL.8.559">and all the stars are seen, to make glad the heart of the shepherd;</p>
	<p id="IL.8.560">such in their numbers blazed the watchfires the Trojans were burning</p>
	<p id="IL.8.561">between the waters of Xanthos and the ships, before Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.562">A thousand fires were burning there in the plain, and beside each</p>
	<p id="IL.8.563">one sat fifty men in the flare of the blazing firelight.</p>
	<p id="IL.8.564">And standing each beside his chariot, champing white barley</p>
	<p id="IL.8.565">and oats, the horses waited for the dawn to mount to her high place.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.1">So the Trojans held their night watches. Meanwhile immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.9.2">Panic, companion of cold Terror, gripped the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.3">as all their best were stricken with grief that passes endurance.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.4">As two winds rise to shake the sea where the fish swarm, Boreas</p>
	<p id="IL.9.5">and Zephyros, north wind and west, that blow from Thraceward,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.6">suddenly descending, and the darkened water is gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.9.7">to crests, and far across the salt water scatters the seaweed;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.8">so the heart in the breast of each Achaian was troubled.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.9">And the son of Atreus, stricken at heart with the great sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.10">went among his heralds the clear-spoken and told them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.11">to summon calling by name each man into the assembly</p>
	<p id="IL.9.12">but with no outcry, and he himself was at work with the foremost.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.13">They took their seats in assembly, dispirited, and Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.9.14">stood up before them, shedding tears, like a spring dark-running</p>
	<p id="IL.9.15">that down the face of a rock impassable drips its dim water.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.16">So, groaning heavily, Agamemnon spoke to the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.17">'Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.18">Zeus son of Kronos has caught me badly in bitter futility.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.19">He is hard: who before this time promised me and consented</p>
	<p id="IL.9.20">that I might sack strong-walled Ilion and sail homeward.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.21">Now he has devised a vile deception and bids me go back</p>
	<p id="IL.9.22">to Argos in dishonour having lost many of my people.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.23">Such is the way it will be pleasing to Zeus, who is too strong,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.24">who before now has broken the crests of many cities</p>
	<p id="IL.9.25">and will break them again, since his power is beyond all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.26">Come then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us</p>
	<p id="IL.9.27">run away with our ships to the beloved land of our fathers</p>
	<p id="IL.9.28">since no longer now shall we capture Troy of the wide ways.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.29">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.30">For some time the sons of the Achaians said nothing in sorrow;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.31">but at long last Diomedes of the great war cry addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.32">'Son of Atreus: I will be first to fight with your folly,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.33">as is my right, lord, in this assembly; then do not be angered.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.34">I was the first of the Danaans whose valour you slighted</p>
	<p id="IL.9.35">and said I was unwarlike and without courage. The young men</p>
	<p id="IL.9.36">of the Argives know all these things, and the elders know it.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.37">The son of devious-devising Kronos has given you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.38">gifts in two ways: with the sceptre he gave you honour beyond all,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.39">but he did not give you a heart, and of all power this is the greatest.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.40">Sir, sir, can you really believe the sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.41">are so unwarlike and so weak of their hearts as you call them?</p>
	<p id="IL.9.42">But if in truth your own heart is so set upon going,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.43">go. The way is there, and next to the water are standing</p>
	<p id="IL.9.44">your ships that came--so many of them!--with you from Mykenai,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.45">and yet the rest of the flowing-haired Achaians will stay here</p>
	<p id="IL.9.46">until we have sacked the city of Troy; let even these also</p>
	<p id="IL.9.47">run away with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.48">still we two, Sthenelos and I, will fight till we witness</p>
	<p id="IL.9.49">the end of Ilion; for it was with God that we made our way hither.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.50">So he spoke, and all the sons of the Achaians shouted</p>
	<p id="IL.9.51">acclaim for the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.52">And now Nestor the horseman stood forth among them and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.53">'Son of Tydeus, beyond others you are strong in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.54">and in counsel also are noblest among all men of your own age.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.55">Not one man of all the Achaians will belittle your words nor</p>
	<p id="IL.9.56">speak against them. Yet you have not made complete your argument,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.57">since you are a young man still and could even be my own son</p>
	<p id="IL.9.58">and my youngest born of all; yet still you argue in wisdom</p>
	<p id="IL.9.59">with the Argive kings, since all you have spoken was spoken fairly.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.60">But let me speak, since I can call myself older than you are,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.61">and go through the whole matter, since there is none who can dishonour</p>
	<p id="IL.9.62">the thing I say, not even powerful Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.63">Out of all brotherhood, outlawed, homeless shall be that man</p>
	<p id="IL.9.64">who longs for all the horror of fighting among his own people.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.65">But now let us give way to the darkness of night, and let us</p>
	<p id="IL.9.66">make ready our evening meal; and let the guards severally</p>
	<p id="IL.9.67">take their stations by the ditch we have dug outside the ramparts.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.68">This I would enjoin upon our young men; but thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.9.69">do you, son of Atreus, take command, since you are our kingliest.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.70">Divide a feast among the princes; it befits you, it is not</p>
	<p id="IL.9.71">unbecoming. Our shelters are filled with wine that the Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.9.72">ships carry day by day from Thrace across the wide water.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.73">All hospitality is for you; you are lord over many.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.74">When many assemble together follow him who advises</p>
	<p id="IL.9.75">the best counsel, for in truth there is need for all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.76">of good close counsel, since now close to our ships the enemy</p>
	<p id="IL.9.77">burn their numerous fires. What man could be cheered to see this?</p>
	<p id="IL.9.78">Here is the night that will break our army, or else will preserve it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.79">So he spoke, and they listened hard to him, and obeyed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.80">and the sentries went forth rapidly in their armour, gathering</p>
	<p id="IL.9.81">about Nestor's son Thrasymedes, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.82">and about Askalaphos and Ialmenos, sons both of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.83">about Meriones and Aphareus and Deïpyros</p>
	<p id="IL.9.84">and about the son of Kreion, Lykomedes the brilliant.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.85">There were seven leaders of the sentinels, and with each one a hundred</p>
	<p id="IL.9.86">fighting men followed gripping in their hands the long spears.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.87">They took position in the space between the ditch and the rampart,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.88">and there they kindled their fires and each made ready his supper.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.89">But the son of Atreus led the assembled lords of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.90">to his own shelter, and set before them the feast in abundance.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.91">They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.92">But when they had put away their desire for eating and drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.93">the aged man began to weave his counsel before them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.94">first, Nestor, whose advice had shown best before this.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.95">He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.96">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.97">with you I will end, with you I will make my beginning, since you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.98">are lord over many people, and Zeus has given into your hand</p>
	<p id="IL.9.99">the sceptre and rights of judgment, to be king over the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.100">It is yours therefore to speak a word, yours also to listen,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.101">and grant the right to another also, when his spirit stirs him</p>
	<p id="IL.9.102">to speak for our good. All shall be yours when you lead the way. Still</p>
	<p id="IL.9.103">I will speak in the way it seems best to my mind, and no one</p>
	<p id="IL.9.104">shall have in his mind any thought that is better than this one</p>
	<p id="IL.9.105">that I have in my mind either now or long before now</p>
	<p id="IL.9.106">ever since that day, illustrious, when you went from the shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.9.107">of angered Achilleus, taking by force the girl Briseis</p>
	<p id="IL.9.108">against the will of the rest of us, since I for my part</p>
	<p id="IL.9.109">urged you strongly not to, but you, giving way to your proud heart's</p>
	<p id="IL.9.110">anger, dishonoured a great man, one whom the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.9.111">honour, since you have taken his prize and keep it. But let us</p>
	<p id="IL.9.112">even now think how we can make this good and persuade him</p>
	<p id="IL.9.113">with words of supplication and with the gifts of friendship.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.114">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.115">'Aged sir, this was no lie when you spoke of my madness.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.116">I was mad, I myself will not deny it. Worth many</p>
	<p id="IL.9.117">fighters is that man whom Zeus in his heart loves, as now</p>
	<p id="IL.9.118">he has honoured this man and beaten down the Achaian people.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.119">But since I was mad, in the persuasion of my heart's evil,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.120">I am willing to make all good, and give back gifts in abundance.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.121">Before you all I will count off my gifts in their splendour:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.122">seven unfired tripods; ten talents' weight of gold; twenty</p>
	<p id="IL.9.123">shining cauldrons; and twelve horses, strong, race-competitors</p>
	<p id="IL.9.124">who have won prizes in the speed of their feet. That man would not be</p>
	<p id="IL.9.125">poor in possessions, to whom were given all these have won me,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.126">nor be unpossessed of dearly honoured gold, were he given</p>
	<p id="IL.9.127">all the prizes these single-foot horses have won for me.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.128">I will give him seven women of Lesbos, the work of whose hands is</p>
	<p id="IL.9.129">blameless, whom when he himself captured strong-founded Lesbos</p>
	<p id="IL.9.130">I chose, and who in their beauty surpassed the races of women.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.131">I will give him these, and with them shall go the one I took from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.132">the daughter of Briseus. And to all this I will swear a great oath</p>
	<p id="IL.9.133">that I never entered into her bed and never lay with her</p>
	<p id="IL.9.134">as is natural for human people, between men and women.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.135">All these gifts shall be his at once; but again, if hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.9.136">the gods grant that we storm and sack the great city of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.137">let him go to his ship and load it deep as he pleases</p>
	<p id="IL.9.138">with gold and bronze, when we Achaians divide the war spoils,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.139">and let him choose for himself twenty of the Trojan women</p>
	<p id="IL.9.140">who are the loveliest of all after Helen of Argos.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.141">And if we come back to Achaian Argos, pride of the tilled land,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.142">he may be my son-in-law; I will honour him with Orestes</p>
	<p id="IL.9.143">my growing son, who is brought up there in abundant luxury.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.144">Since, as I have three daughters there in my strong-built castle,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.145">Chrysothemis and Laodike and Iphianassa,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.146">let him lead away the one of these that he likes, with no bride-price,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.147">to the house of Peleus, and with the girl I will grant him as dowry</p>
	<p id="IL.9.148">many gifts, such as no man ever gave with his daughter.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.149">I will grant to him seven citadels, strongly settled:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.150">Kardamyle, and Enope, and Hire of the grasses,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.151">Pherai the sacrosanct, and Antheia deep in the meadows,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.152">with Aipeia the lovely and Pedasos of the vineyards.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.153">All these lie near the sea, at the bottom of sandy Pylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.154">and men live among them rich in cattle and rich in sheepflocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.155">who will honour him as if he were a god with gifts given</p>
	<p id="IL.9.156">and fulfil his prospering decrees underneath his sceptre.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.157">All this I will bring to pass for him, if he changes from his anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.158">Let him give way. For Hades gives not way, and is pitiless,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.159">and therefore he among all the gods is most hateful to mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.160">And let him yield place to me, inasmuch as I am the kinglier</p>
	<p id="IL.9.161">and inasmuch as I can call myself born the elder.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.162">Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.163">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.164">none could scorn any longer these gifts you offer to Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.9.165">the king. Come, let us choose and send some men, who in all speed</p>
	<p id="IL.9.166">will go to the shelter of Achilleus, the son of Peleus;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.167">or come, the men on whom my eye falls, let these take the duty.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.168">First of all let Phoinix, beloved of Zeus, be their leader,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.169">and after him take Aias the great, and brilliant Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.170">and of the heralds let Odios and Eurybates go with them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.171">Bring also water for their hands, and bid them keep words of good omen,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.172">so we may pray to Zeus, son of Kronos, if he will have pity.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.173">So he spoke, and the word he spoke was pleasing to all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.174">And the heralds brought water at once, and poured it over</p>
	<p id="IL.9.175">their hands, and the young men filled the mixing-bowl with pure wine</p>
	<p id="IL.9.176">and passed it to all, pouring first a libation in goblets.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.177">Then when they had poured out wine, and drunk as much as their hearts wished,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.178">they set out from the shelter of Atreus' son, Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.179">And the Gerenian horseman Nestor gave them much instruction,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.180">looking eagerly at each, and most of all at Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.181">to try hard, so that they might win over the blameless Peleion.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.182">So these two walked along the strand of the sea deep-thundering</p>
	<p id="IL.9.183">with many prayers to the holder and shaker of the earth, that they</p>
	<p id="IL.9.184">might readily persuade the great heart of Aiakides.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.185">Now they came beside the shelters and ships of the Myrmidons</p>
	<p id="IL.9.186">and they found Achilleus delighting his heart in a lyre, clear-sounding,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.187">splendid and carefully wrought, with a bridge of silver upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.188">which he won out of the spoils when he ruined Eëtion's city.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.189">With this he was pleasuring his heart, and singing of men's fame,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.190">as Patroklos was sitting over against him, alone, in silence,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.191">watching Aiakides and the time he would leave off singing.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.192">Now these two came forward, as brilliant Odysseus led them,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.193">and stood in his presence. Achilleus rose to his feet in amazement</p>
	<p id="IL.9.194">holding the lyre as it was, leaving the place where he was sitting.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.195">In the same way Patroklos, when he saw the men come, stood up.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.196">And in greeting Achilleus the swift of foot spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.197">'Welcome. You are my friends who have come, and greatly I need you,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.198">who even to this my anger are dearest of all the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.199">So brilliant Achilleus spoke, and guided them forward,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.200">and caused them to sit down on couches with purple coverlets</p>
	<p id="IL.9.201">and at once called over to Patroklos who was not far from him:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.202">'Son of Menoitios, set up a mixing-bowl that is bigger,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.203">and mix us stronger drink, and make ready a cup for each man,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.204">since these who have come beneath my roof are the men that I love best.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.205">So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.206">and tossed down a great chopping-block into the firelight,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.207">and laid upon it the back of a sheep, and one of a fat goat,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.208">with the chine of a fatted pig edged thick with lard, and for him</p>
	<p id="IL.9.209">Automedon held the meats, and brilliant Achilleus carved them,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.210">and cut it well into pieces and spitted them, as meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.9.211">Menoitios' son, a man like a god, made the fire blaze greatly.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.212">But when the fire had burned itself out, and the flames had died down,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.213">he scattered the embers apart, and extended the spits across them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.214">lifting them to the andirons, and sprinkled the meats with divine salt.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.215">Then when he had roasted all, and spread the food on the platters,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.216">Patroklos took the bread and set it out on a table</p>
	<p id="IL.9.217">in fair baskets, while Achilleus served the meats. Thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.9.218">he himself sat over against the godlike Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.9.219">against the further wall, and told his companion, Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.220">to sacrifice to the gods; and he threw the firstlings in the fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.221">They put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.222">But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.223">Aias nodded to Phoinix, and brilliant Odysseus saw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.224">and filled a cup with wine, and lifted it to Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.225">'Your health, Achilleus. You have no lack of your equal portion</p>
	<p id="IL.9.226">either within the shelter of Atreus' son, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.227">nor here now in your own. We have good things in abundance</p>
	<p id="IL.9.228">to feast on; here it is not the desirable feast we think of,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.229">but a trouble all too great, beloved of Zeus, that we look on</p>
	<p id="IL.9.230">and are afraid. There is doubt if we save our strong-benched vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.9.231">or if they will be destroyed, unless you put on your war strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.232">The Trojans in their pride, with their far-renowned companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.233">have set up an encampment close by the ships and the rampart,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.234">and lit many fires along their army, and think no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.9.235">of being held, but rather to drive in upon the black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.236">And Zeus, son of Kronos, lightens upon their right hand, showing them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.237">portents of good, while Hektor in the huge pride of his strength rages</p>
	<p id="IL.9.238">irresistibly, reliant on Zeus, and gives way to no one</p>
	<p id="IL.9.239">neither god nor man, but the strong fury has descended upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.240">He prays now that the divine Dawn will show most quickly,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.241">since he threatens to shear the uttermost horns from the ship-sterns,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.242">to light the ships themselves with ravening fire, and to cut down</p>
	<p id="IL.9.243">the Achaians themselves as they stir from the smoke beside them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.244">All this I fear terribly in my heart, lest immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.9.245">accomplish all these threats, and lest for us it be destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.9.246">to die here in Troy, far away from horse-pasturing Argos.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.247">Up, then! if you are minded, late though it be, to rescue</p>
	<p id="IL.9.248">the afflicted sons of the Achaians from the Trojan onslaught.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.249">It will be an affliction to you hereafter, there will be no remedy</p>
	<p id="IL.9.250">found to heal the evil thing when it has been done. No, beforehand</p>
	<p id="IL.9.251">take thought to beat the evil day aside from the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.252">Dear friend, surely thus your father Peleus advised you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.253">that day when he sent you away to Agamemnon from Phthia:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.254">"My child, for the matter of strength, Athene and Hera will give it</p>
	<p id="IL.9.255">if it be their will, but be it yours to hold fast in your bosom</p>
	<p id="IL.9.256">the anger of the proud heart, for consideration is better.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.257">Keep from the bad complication of quarrel, and all the more for this</p>
	<p id="IL.9.258">the Argives will honour you, both their younger men and their elders."</p>
	<p id="IL.9.259">So the old man advised, but you have forgotten. Yet even now</p>
	<p id="IL.9.260">stop, and give way from the anger that hurts the heart. Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.9.261">offers you worthy recompense if you change from your anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.262">Come then, if you will, listen to me, while I count off for you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.263">all the gifts in his shelter that Agamemnon has promised:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.264">Seven unfired tripods; ten talents' weight of gold; twenty</p>
	<p id="IL.9.265">shining cauldrons; and twelve horses, strong, race-competitors</p>
	<p id="IL.9.266">who have won prizes in the speed of their feet. That man would not be</p>
	<p id="IL.9.267">poor in possessions, to whom were given all these have won him,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.268">nor be unpossessed of dearly honoured gold, were he given</p>
	<p id="IL.9.269">all the prizes Agamemnon's horses won in their speed for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.270">He will give you seven women of Lesbos, the work of whose hands</p>
	<p id="IL.9.271">is blameless, whom when you yourself captured strong-founded Lesbos</p>
	<p id="IL.9.272">he chose, and who in their beauty surpassed the races of women.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.273">He will give you these, and with them shall go the one he took from you,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.274">the daughter of Briseus. And to all this he will swear a great oath</p>
	<p id="IL.9.275">that he never entered into her bed and never lay with her</p>
	<p id="IL.9.276">as is natural for human people, between men and women.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.277">All these gifts shall be yours at once; but again, if hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.9.278">the gods grant that we storm and sack the great city of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.279">you may go to your ship and load it deep as you please with</p>
	<p id="IL.9.280">gold and bronze, when we Achaians divide the war spoils,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.281">and you may choose for yourself twenty of the Trojan women,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.282">who are the loveliest of all after Helen of Argos.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.283">And if we come back to Achaian Argos, pride of the tilled land,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.284">you could be his son-in-law; he would honour you with Orestes,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.285">his growing son, who is brought up there in abundant luxury.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.286">Since, as he has three daughters there in his strong-built castle,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.287">Chrysothemis and Laodike and Iphianassa,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.288">you may lead away the one of these that you like, with no bride-price,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.289">to the house of Peleus; and with the girl he will grant you as dowry</p>
	<p id="IL.9.290">many gifts, such as no man ever gave with his daughter.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.291">He will grant you seven citadels, strongly settled:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.292">Kardamyle and Enope and Hire of the grasses,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.293">Pherai the sacrosanct, and Antheia deep in the meadows,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.294">with Aipeia the lovely, and Pedasos of the vineyards.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.295">All these lie near the sea, at the bottom of sandy Pylos,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.296">and men live among them rich in cattle and rich in sheepflocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.297">who will honour you as if you were a god with gifts given</p>
	<p id="IL.9.298">and fulfil your prospering decrees underneath your sceptre.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.299">All this he will bring to pass for you, if you change from your anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.300">But if the son of Atreus is too much hated in your heart,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.301">himself and his gifts, at least take pity on all the other</p>
	<p id="IL.9.302">Achaians, who are afflicted along the host, and will honour you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.303">as a god. You may win very great glory among them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.304">For now you might kill Hektor, since he would come very close to you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.305">with the wicked fury upon him, since he thinks there is not his equal</p>
	<p id="IL.9.306">among the rest of the Danaans the ships carried hither.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.307">Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.308">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.309">without consideration for you I must make my answer,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.310">the way I think, and the way it will be accomplished, that you may not</p>
	<p id="IL.9.311">come one after another, and sit by me, and speak softly.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.312">For as I detest the doorways of Death, I detest that man, who</p>
	<p id="IL.9.313">hides one thing in the depths of his heart, and speaks forth another.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.314">But I will speak to you the way it seems best to me: neither</p>
	<p id="IL.9.315">do I think the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, will persuade me,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.316">nor the rest of the Danaans, since there was no gratitude given</p>
	<p id="IL.9.317">for fighting incessantly forever against your enemies.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.318">Fate is the same for the man who holds back, the same if he fights hard.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.319">We are all held in a single honour, the brave with the weaklings.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.320">A man dies still if he has done nothing, as one who has done much.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.321">Nothing is won for me, now that my heart has gone through its afflictions</p>
	<p id="IL.9.322">in forever setting my life on the hazard of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.323">For as to her unwinged young ones the mother bird brings back</p>
	<p id="IL.9.324">morsels, wherever she can find them, but as for herself it is suffering,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.325">such was I, as I lay through all the many nights unsleeping,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.326">such as I wore through the bloody days of the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.327">striving with warriors for the sake of these men's women.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.328">But I say that I have stormed from my ships twelve cities</p>
	<p id="IL.9.329">of men, and by land eleven more through the generous Troad.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.330">From all these we took forth treasures, goodly and numerous,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.331">and we would bring them back, and give them to Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.332">Atreus' son; while he, waiting back beside the swift ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.333">would take them, and distribute them little by little, and keep many.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.334">All the other prizes of honour he gave the great men and the princes</p>
	<p id="IL.9.335">are held fast by them, but from me alone of all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.336">he has taken and keeps the bride of my heart. Let him lie beside her</p>
	<p id="IL.9.337">and be happy. Yet why must the Argives fight with the Trojans?</p>
	<p id="IL.9.338">And why was it the son of Atreus assembled and led here</p>
	<p id="IL.9.339">these people? Was it not for the sake of lovely-haired Helen?</p>
	<p id="IL.9.340">Are the sons of Atreus alone among mortal men the ones</p>
	<p id="IL.9.341">who love their wives? Since any who is a good man, and careful,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.342">loves her who is his own and cares for her, even as I now</p>
	<p id="IL.9.343">loved this one from my heart, though it was my spear that won her.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.344">Now that he has deceived me and taken from my hands my prize of honour,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.345">let him try me no more. I know him well. He will not persuade me.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.346">Let him take counsel with you, Odysseus, and the rest of the princes</p>
	<p id="IL.9.347">how to fight the ravening fire away from his vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.348">Indeed, there has been much hard work done even without me;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.349">he has built himself a wall and driven a ditch about it,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.350">making it great and wide, and fixed the sharp stakes inside it.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.351">Yet even so he cannot hold the strength of manslaughtering</p>
	<p id="IL.9.352">Hektor; and yet when I was fighting among the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.353">Hektor would not drive his attack beyond the wall's shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.9.354">but would come forth only so far as the Skaian gates and the oak tree.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.355">There once he endured me alone, and barely escaped my onslaught.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.356">But, now I am unwilling to fight against brilliant Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.357">tomorrow, when I have sacrificed to Zeus and to all gods,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.358">and loaded well my ships, and rowed out on to the salt water,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.359">you will see, if you have a mind to it and if it concerns you,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.360">my ships in the dawn at sea on the Hellespont where the fish swarm</p>
	<p id="IL.9.361">and my men manning them with good will to row. If the glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.9.362">shaker of the earth should grant us a favouring passage</p>
	<p id="IL.9.363">on the third day thereafter we might raise generous Phthia.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.364">I have many possessions there that I left behind when I came here</p>
	<p id="IL.9.365">on this desperate venture, and from here there is more gold, and red bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.366">and fair-girdled women, and grey iron I will take back;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.367">all that was allotted to me. But my prize: he who gave it,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.368">powerful Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has taken it back again</p>
	<p id="IL.9.369">outrageously. Go back and proclaim to him all that I tell you,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.370">openly, so other Achaians may turn against him in anger</p>
	<p id="IL.9.371">if he hopes yet one more time to swindle some other Danaan,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.372">wrapped as he is forever in shamelessness; yet he would not,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.373">bold as a dog though he be, dare look in my face any longer.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.374">I will join with him in no counsel, and in no action.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.375">He cheated me and he did me hurt. Let him not beguile me</p>
	<p id="IL.9.376">with words again. This is enough for him. Let him of his own will</p>
	<p id="IL.9.377">be damned, since Zeus of the counsels has taken his wits away from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.378">I hate his gifts. I hold him light as the strip of a splinter.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.379">Not if he gave me ten times as much, and twenty times over</p>
	<p id="IL.9.380">as he possesses now, not if more should come to him from elsewhere,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.381">or gave all that is brought in to Orchomenos, all that is brought in</p>
	<p id="IL.9.382">to Thebes of Egypt, where the greatest possessions lie up in the houses,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.383">Thebes of the hundred gates, where through each of the gates two hundred</p>
	<p id="IL.9.384">fighting men come forth to war with horses and chariots;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.385">not if he gave me gifts as many as the sand or the dust is,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.386">not even so would Agamemnon have his way with my spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.9.387">until he had made good to me all this heartrending insolence.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.388">Nor will I marry a daughter of Atreus' son, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.389">not if she challenged Aphrodite the golden for loveliness,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.390">not if she matched the work of her hands with grey-eyed Athene;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.391">not even so will I marry her; let him pick some other Achaian,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.392">one who is to his liking and is kinglier than I am.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.393">For if the gods will keep me alive, and I win homeward,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.394">Peleus himself will presently arrange a wife for me.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.395">There are many Achaian girls in the land of Hellas and Phthia,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.396">daughters of great men who hold strong places in guard. And of these</p>
	<p id="IL.9.397">any one that I please I might make my beloved lady.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.398">And the great desire in my heart drives me rather in that place</p>
	<p id="IL.9.399">to take a wedded wife in marriage, the bride of my fancy,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.400">to enjoy with her the possessions won by aged Peleus. For not</p>
	<p id="IL.9.401">worth the value of my life are all the possessions they fable</p>
	<p id="IL.9.402">were won for Ilion, that strong-founded citadel, in the old days</p>
	<p id="IL.9.403">when there was peace, before the coming of the sons of the Achaians;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.404">not all that the stone doorsill of the Archer holds fast within it,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.405">of Phoibos Apollo in Pytho of the rocks. Of possessions</p>
	<p id="IL.9.406">cattle and fat sheep are things to be had for the lifting,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.407">and tripods can be won, and the tawny high heads of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.408">but a man's life cannot come back again, it cannot be lifted</p>
	<p id="IL.9.409">nor captured again by force, once it has crossed the teeth's barrier.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.410">For my mother Thetis the goddess of the silver feet tells me</p>
	<p id="IL.9.411">I carry two sorts of destiny toward the day of my death. Either,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.412">if I stay here and fight beside the city of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.413">my return home is gone, but my glory shall be everlasting;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.414">but if I return home to the beloved land of my fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.415">the excellence of my glory is gone, but there will be a long life</p>
	<p id="IL.9.416">left for me, and my end in death will not come to me quickly.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.417">And this would be my counsel to others also, to sail back</p>
	<p id="IL.9.418">home again, since no longer shall you find any term set</p>
	<p id="IL.9.419">on the sheer city of Ilion, since Zeus of the wide brows has strongly</p>
	<p id="IL.9.420">held his own hand over it, and its people are made bold.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.421">Do you go back therefore to the great men of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.422">and take them this message, since such is the privilege of the princes:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.423">that they think out in their minds some other scheme that is better,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.424">which might rescue their ships, and the people of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.9.425">who man the hollow ships, since this plan will not work for them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.426">which they thought of by reason of my anger. Let Phoinix</p>
	<p id="IL.9.427">remain here with us and sleep here, so that tomorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.9.428">he may come with us in our ships to the beloved land of our fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.429">if he will; but I will never use force to hold him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.430">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence</p>
	<p id="IL.9.431">in amazement at his words. He had spoken to them very strongly.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.432">But at long last Phoinix the aged horseman spoke out</p>
	<p id="IL.9.433">in a stormburst of tears, and fearing for the ships of the Achaians:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.434">'If it is going home, glorious Achilleus, you ponder</p>
	<p id="IL.9.435">in your heart, and are utterly unwilling to drive the obliterating</p>
	<p id="IL.9.436">fire from the fast ships, since anger has descended on your spirit,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.437">how then shall I, dear child, be left in this place behind you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.438">all alone? Peleus the aged horseman sent me forth with you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.439">on that day when he sent you from Phthia to Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.9.440">a mere child, who knew nothing yet of the joining of battle</p>
	<p id="IL.9.441">nor of debate where men are made pre-eminent. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.9.442">he sent me along with you to teach you of all these matters,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.443">to make you a speaker of words and one who accomplished in action.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.444">Therefore apart from you, dear child, I would not be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.9.445">to be left behind, not were the god in person to promise</p>
	<p id="IL.9.446">he would scale away my old age and make me a young man blossoming</p>
	<p id="IL.9.447">as I was that time when I first left Hellas, the land of fair women,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.448">running from the hatred of Ormenos' son Amyntor,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.449">my father; who hated me for the sake of a fair-haired mistress.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.450">For he made love to her himself, and dishonoured his own wife,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.451">my mother; who was forever taking my knees and entreating me</p>
	<p id="IL.9.452">to lie with this mistress instead so that she would hate the old man.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.453">I was persuaded and did it; and my father when he heard of it straightway</p>
	<p id="IL.9.454">called down his curses, and invoked against me the dreaded furies</p>
	<p id="IL.9.455">that I might never have any son born of my seed to dandle</p>
	<p id="IL.9.456">on my knees; and the divinities, Zeus of the underworld</p>
	<p id="IL.9.457">and Persephone the honoured goddess, accomplished his curses.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.458">Then I took it into my mind to cut him down with the sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.459">but some one of the immortals checked my anger, reminding me</p>
	<p id="IL.9.460">of rumour among the people and men's maledictions repeated,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.461">that I might not be called a parricide among the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.462">But now no more could the heart in my breast be ruled entirely</p>
	<p id="IL.9.463">to range still among these halls when my father was angered.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.464">Rather it was the many kinsmen and cousins about me</p>
	<p id="IL.9.465">who held me closed in the house, with supplications repeated,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.466">and slaughtered fat sheep in their numbers, and shambling horn-curved</p>
	<p id="IL.9.467">cattle, and numerous swine with the fat abundant upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.468">were singed and stretched out across the flame of Hephaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.469">and much wine was drunk that was stored in the jars of the old man.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.470">Nine nights they slept nightlong in their places beside me,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.471">and they kept up an interchange of watches, and the fire was never</p>
	<p id="IL.9.472">put out; one below the gate of the strong-closed courtyard,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.473">and one in the ante-chamber before the doors of the bedroom.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.474">But when the tenth night had come to me in its darkness,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.475">then I broke the close-compacted doors of the chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.9.476">and got away, and overleapt the fence of the courtyard</p>
	<p id="IL.9.477">lightly, unnoticed by the guarding men and the women servants.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.478">Then I fled far away through the wide spaces of Hellas</p>
	<p id="IL.9.479">and came as far as generous Phthia, mother of sheepflocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.480">and to lord Peleus, who accepted me with a good will</p>
	<p id="IL.9.481">and gave me his love, even as a father loves his own son</p>
	<p id="IL.9.482">who is a single child brought up among many possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.483">He made me a rich man, and granted me many people,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.484">and I lived, lord over the Dolopes, in remotest Phthia,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.485">and, godlike Achilleus, I made you all that you are now,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.486">and loved you out of my heart, for you would not go with another</p>
	<p id="IL.9.487">out to any feast, nor taste any food in your own halls</p>
	<p id="IL.9.488">until I had set you on my knees, and cut little pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.9.489">from the meat, and given you all you wished, and held the wine for you.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.490">And many times you soaked the shirt that was on my body</p>
	<p id="IL.9.491">with wine you would spit up in the troublesomeness of your childhood.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.492">So I have suffered much through you, and have had much trouble,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.493">thinking always how the gods would not bring to birth any children</p>
	<p id="IL.9.494">of my own; so that it was you, godlike Achilleus, I made</p>
	<p id="IL.9.495">my own child, so that some day you might keep hard affliction from me.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.496">Then, Achilleus, beat down your great anger. It is not</p>
	<p id="IL.9.497">yours to have a pitiless heart. The very immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.9.498">can be moved; their virtue and honour and strength are greater than ours are,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.499">and yet with sacrifices and offerings for endearment,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.500">with libations and with savour men turn back even the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.9.501">in supplication, when any man does wrong and transgresses.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.502">For there are also the spirits of Prayer, the daughters of great Zeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.503">and they are lame of their feet, and wrinkled, and cast their eyes sidelong,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.504">who toil on their way left far behind by the spirit of Ruin:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.505">but she, Ruin, is strong and sound on her feet, and therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.9.506">far outruns all Prayers, and wins into every country</p>
	<p id="IL.9.507">to force men astray; and the Prayers follow as healers after her.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.508">If a man venerates these daughters of Zeus as they draw near,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.509">such a man they bring great advantage, and hear his entreaty;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.510">but if a man shall deny them, and stubbornly with a harsh word</p>
	<p id="IL.9.511">refuse, they go to Zeus, son of Kronos, in supplication</p>
	<p id="IL.9.512">that Ruin may overtake this man, that he be hurt, and punished.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.513">So, Achilleus: grant, you also, that Zeus' daughters be given</p>
	<p id="IL.9.514">their honour, which, lordly though they be, curbs the will of others.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.515">Since, were he not bringing gifts and naming still more hereafter,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.516">Atreus' son; were he to remain still swollen with rancour,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.517">even I would not bid you throw your anger aside, nor</p>
	<p id="IL.9.518">defend the Argives, though they needed you sorely. But see now,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.519">he offers you much straightway, and has promised you more hereafter;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.520">he has sent the best men to you to supplicate you, choosing them</p>
	<p id="IL.9.521">out of the Achaian host, those who to yourself are the dearest</p>
	<p id="IL.9.522">of all the Argives. Do not you make vain their argument</p>
	<p id="IL.9.523">nor their footsteps, though before this one could not blame your anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.524">Thus it was in the old days also, the deeds that we hear of</p>
	<p id="IL.9.525">from the great men, when the swelling anger descended upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.526">The heroes would take gifts; they would listen, and be persuaded.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.527">For I remember this action of old, it is not a new thing,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.528">and how it went; you are all my friends, I will tell it among you.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.529">The Kouretes and the steadfast Aitolians were fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.9.530">and slaughtering one another about the city of Kalydon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.531">the Aitolians in lovely Kalydon's defence, the Kouretes</p>
	<p id="IL.9.532">furious to storm and sack it in war. For Artemis,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.533">she of the golden chair, had driven this evil upon them,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.534">angered that Oineus had not given the pride of the orchards</p>
	<p id="IL.9.535">to her, first fruits; the rest of the gods were given due sacrifice,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.536">but alone to this daughter of great Zeus he had given nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.537">He had forgotten, or had not thought, in his hard delusion,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.538">and in wrath at his whole mighty line the Lady of Arrows</p>
	<p id="IL.9.539">sent upon them the fierce wild boar with the shining teeth, who</p>
	<p id="IL.9.540">after the way of his kind did much evil to the orchards of Oineus.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.541">For he ripped up whole tall trees from the ground and scattered them headlong</p>
	<p id="IL.9.542">roots and all, even to the very flowers of the orchard.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.543">The son of Oineus killed this boar, Meleagros, assembling</p>
	<p id="IL.9.544">together many hunting men out of numerous cities</p>
	<p id="IL.9.545">with their hounds; since the boar might not have been killed by a few men,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.546">so huge was he, and had put many men on the sad fire for burning.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.547">But the goddess again made a great stir of anger and crying</p>
	<p id="IL.9.548">battle, over the head of the boar and the bristling boar's hide,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.549">between Kouretes and the high-hearted Aitolians. So long</p>
	<p id="IL.9.550">as Meleagros lover of battle stayed in the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.9.551">it went the worse for the Kouretes, and they could not even</p>
	<p id="IL.9.552">hold their ground outside the wall, though they were so many.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.553">But when the anger came upon Meleagros, such anger</p>
	<p id="IL.9.554">as wells in the hearts of others also, though their minds are careful,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.555">he, in the wrath of his heart against his own mother, Althaia,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.556">lay apart with his wedded bride, Kleopatra the lovely,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.557">daughter of sweet-stepping Marpessa, child of Euenos,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.558">and Idas, who was the strongest of all men upon earth</p>
	<p id="IL.9.559">in his time; for the even took up the bow to face the King's onset,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.560">Phoibos Apollo, for the sake of the sweet-stepping maiden;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.561">a girl her father and honoured mother had named in their palace</p>
	<p id="IL.9.562">Alkyone, sea-bird, as a by-name, since for her sake</p>
	<p id="IL.9.563">her mother with the sorrow-laden cry of a sea-bird</p>
	<p id="IL.9.564">wept because far-reaching Phoibos Apollo had taken her;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.565">with this Kleopatra he lay mulling his heart-sore anger,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.566">raging by reason of his mother's curses, which she called down</p>
	<p id="IL.9.567">from the gods upon him, in deep grief for the death of her brother,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.568">and many times beating with her hands on the earth abundant</p>
	<p id="IL.9.569">she called on Hades and on honoured Persephone, lying</p>
	<p id="IL.9.570">at length along the ground, and the tears were wet on her bosom,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.571">to give death to her son; and Erinys, the mist-walking,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.572">she of the heart without pity, heard her out of the dark places.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.573">Presently there was thunder about the gates, and the sound rose</p>
	<p id="IL.9.574">of towers under assault, and the Aitolian elders</p>
	<p id="IL.9.575">supplicated him, sending their noblest priests of the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.576">to come forth and defend them; they offered him a great gift:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.577">wherever might lie the richest ground in lovely Kalydon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.578">there they told him to choose out a piece of land, an entirely</p>
	<p id="IL.9.579">good one, of fifty acres, the half of it to be vineyard</p>
	<p id="IL.9.580">and the half of it unworked ploughland of the plain to be furrowed.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.581">And the aged horseman Oineus again and again entreated him,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.582">and took his place at the threshold of the high-vaulted chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.9.583">and shook against the bolted doors, pleading with his own son.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.584">And again and again his honoured mother and his sisters</p>
	<p id="IL.9.585">entreated him, but he only refused the more; then his own friends</p>
	<p id="IL.9.586">who were the most honoured and dearest of all entreated him;</p>
	<p id="IL.9.587">but even so they could not persuade the heart within him</p>
	<p id="IL.9.588">until, as the chamber was under close assault, the Kouretes</p>
	<p id="IL.9.589">were mounting along the towers and set fire to the great city.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.590">And then at last his wife, the fair-girdled bride, supplicated</p>
	<p id="IL.9.591">Meleagros, in tears, and rehearsed in their numbers before him</p>
	<p id="IL.9.592">all the sorrows that come to men when their city is taken:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.593">they kill the men, and the fire leaves the city in ashes,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.594">and strangers lead the children away and the deep-girdled women.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.595">And the heart, as he listened to all this evil, was stirred within him,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.596">and he rose, and went, and closed his body in shining armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.597">So he gave way in his own heart, and drove back the day of evil</p>
	<p id="IL.9.598">from the Aitolians; yet these no longer would make good</p>
	<p id="IL.9.599">their many and gracious gifts; yet he drove back the evil from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.600">Listen, then; do not have such a thought in your mind; let not</p>
	<p id="IL.9.601">the spirit within you turn you that way, dear friend. It would be worse</p>
	<p id="IL.9.602">to defend the ships after they are burning. No, with gifts promised</p>
	<p id="IL.9.603">go forth. The Achaians will honour you as they would an immortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.604">But if without gifts you go into the fighting where men perish,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.605">your honour will no longer be as great, though you drive back the battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.606">Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.607">'Phoinix my father, aged, illustrious, such honour is a thing</p>
	<p id="IL.9.608">I need not. I think I am honoured already in Zeus' ordinance</p>
	<p id="IL.9.609">which will hold me here beside my curved ships as long as life's wind</p>
	<p id="IL.9.610">stays in my breast, as long as my knees have their spring beneath me.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.611">And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.612">Stop confusing my heart with lamentation and sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.9.613">for the favour of great Atreides. It does not become you</p>
	<p id="IL.9.614">to love this man, for fear you turn hateful to me, who love you.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.615">It should be your pride with me to hurt whoever shall hurt me.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.616">Be king equally with me; take half of my honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.617">These men will carry back the message; you stay here and sleep here</p>
	<p id="IL.9.618">in a soft bed, and we shall decide tomorrow, as dawn shows,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.619">whether to go back home again or else to remain here.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.620">He spoke, and, saying nothing, nodded with his brows to Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.9.621">to make up a neat bed for Phoinix, so the others might presently</p>
	<p id="IL.9.622">think of going home from his shelter. The son of Telamon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.623">Aias the godlike, saw it, and now spoke his word among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.624">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.625">let us go. I think that nothing will be accomplished</p>
	<p id="IL.9.626">by argument on this errand; it is best to go back quickly</p>
	<p id="IL.9.627">and tell this story, though it is not good, to the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.9.628">who sit there waiting for us to come back, seeing that Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.9.629">has made savage the proud-hearted spirit within his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.630">He is hard, and does not remember that friends' affection</p>
	<p id="IL.9.631">wherein we honoured him by the ships, far beyond all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.632">Pitiless. And yet a man takes from his brother's slayer</p>
	<p id="IL.9.633">the blood price, or the price for a child who was killed, and the guilty</p>
	<p id="IL.9.634">one, when he has largely repaid, stays still in the country,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.635">and the injured man's heart is curbed, and his pride, and his anger</p>
	<p id="IL.9.636">when he has taken the price; but the gods put in your breast a spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.9.637">not to be placated, bad, for the sake of one single</p>
	<p id="IL.9.638">girl. Yet now we offer you seven, surpassingly lovely,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.639">and much beside these. Now make gracious the spirit within you.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.640">Respect your own house; see, we are under the same roof with you,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.641">from the multitude of the Danaans, we who desire beyond all</p>
	<p id="IL.9.642">others to have your honour and love, out of all the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.643">Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.644">'Son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, Aias, lord of the people:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.645">all that you have said seems spoken after my own mind.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.646">Yet still the heart in me swells up in anger, when I remember</p>
	<p id="IL.9.647">the disgrace that he wrought upon me before the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.648">the son of Atreus, as if I were some dishonoured vagabond.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.649">Do you then go back to him, and take him this message:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.650">that I shall not think again of the bloody fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.9.651">until such time as the son of wise Priam, Hektor the brilliant,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.652">comes all the way to the ships of the Myrmidons, and their shelters,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.653">slaughtering the Argives, and shall darken with fire our vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.654">But around my own shelter, I think, and beside my black ship</p>
	<p id="IL.9.655">Hektor will be held, though he be very hungry for battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.656">He spoke, and they taking each a two-handled cup poured out</p>
	<p id="IL.9.657">a libation, then went back to their ships, and Odysseus led them.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.658">Now Patroklos gave the maids and his followers orders</p>
	<p id="IL.9.659">to make up without delay a neat bed for Phoinix.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.660">And these obeyed him and made up the bed as he had commanded,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.661">laying fleeces on it, and a blanket, and a sheet of fine linen.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.662">There the old man lay down and waited for the divine Dawn.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.663">But Achilleus slept in the inward corner of the strong-built shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.664">and a woman lay beside him, one he had taken from Lesbos,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.665">Phorbas' daughter, Diomede of the fair colouring.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.666">In the other corner Patroklos went to bed; with him also</p>
	<p id="IL.9.667">was a girl, Iphis the fair-girdled, whom brilliant Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.9.668">gave him, when he took sheer Skyros, Enyeus' citadel.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.669">Now when these had come back to the shelters of Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.670">the sons of the Achaians greeted them with their gold cups</p>
	<p id="IL.9.671">uplifted, one after another, standing, and asked them questions.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.672">And the first to question them was the lord of men, Agamemnon:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.673">'Tell me, honoured Odysseus, great glory of the Achaians:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.674">is he willing to fight the ravening fire away from our vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.675">or did he refuse, and does the anger still hold his proud heart?'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.676">Then long-suffering great Odysseus spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.677">'Son of Atreus, most lordly, king of men, Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.678">That man will not quench his anger, but still more than ever</p>
	<p id="IL.9.679">is filled with rage. He refuses you and refuses your presents.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.680">He tells you yourself to take counsel among the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.9.681">how to save your ships, and the people of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.682">And he himself has threatened that tomorrow as dawn shows</p>
	<p id="IL.9.683">he will drag down his strong-benched, oarswept ships to the water.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.684">He said it would be his counsel to others also, to sail back</p>
	<p id="IL.9.685">home again, since no longer will you find any term set</p>
	<p id="IL.9.686">on the sheer city of Ilion, since Zeus of the wide brows has strongly</p>
	<p id="IL.9.687">held his own hand over it, and its people are made bold.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.688">So he spoke. There are these to attest it who went there with me</p>
	<p id="IL.9.689">also, Aias, and the two heralds, both men of good counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.690">But aged Phoinix stayed there for the night, as Achilleus urged him,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.691">so he might go home in the ships to the beloved land of his fathers</p>
	<p id="IL.9.692">if Phoinix will; but he will never use force to persuade him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.693">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence</p>
	<p id="IL.9.694">in amazement at his words. He had spoken to them very strongly.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.695">For a long time the sons of the Achaians said nothing, in sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.696">but at long last Diomedes of the great war cry spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.9.697">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.698">I wish you had not supplicated the blameless son of Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.9.699">with innumerable gifts offered. He is a proud man without this,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.700">and now you have driven him far deeper into his pride. Rather</p>
	<p id="IL.9.701">we shall pay him no more attention, whether he comes in with us</p>
	<p id="IL.9.702">or stays away. He will fight again, whenever the time comes</p>
	<p id="IL.9.703">that the heart in his body urges him to, and the god drives him.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.704">Come then, do as I say, and let us all be won over.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.705">Go to sleep, now that the inward heart is made happy</p>
	<p id="IL.9.706">with food and drink, for these are the strength and courage within us.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.707">But when the lovely dawn shows forth with rose fingers, Atreides,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.708">rapidly form before our ships both people and horses</p>
	<p id="IL.9.709">stirring them on, and yourself be ready to fight in the foremost.'</p>
	<p id="IL.9.710">So he spoke, and all the kings gave him their approval,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.711">acclaiming the word of Diomedes, breaker of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.9.712">Then they poured a libation, and each man went to his shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.9.713">where they went to their beds and took the blessing of slumber.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.1">Now beside their ships the other great men of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.10.2">slept night long, with the soft bondage of slumber upon them;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.3">but the son of Atreus, Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.4">was held by no sweet sleep as he pondered deeply within him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.5">As when the lord of Hera the lovely-haired flashes his lightning</p>
	<p id="IL.10.6">as he brings on a great rainstorm, or a hail incessant,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.7">or a blizzard, at such time when the snowfall scatters on ploughlands,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.8">or drives on somewhere on earth the huge edge of tearing battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.9">such was Agamemnon, with the beating turmoil in his bosom</p>
	<p id="IL.10.10">from the deep heart, and all his wits were shaken within him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.11">Now he would gaze across the plain to the Trojan camp, wondering</p>
	<p id="IL.10.12">at the number of their fires that were burning in front of Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.13">toward the high calls of their flutes and pipes, the murmur of people.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.14">Now as he would look again to the ships and the Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.10.15">people, he would drag the hair by its roots from his head, looking</p>
	<p id="IL.10.16">toward Zeus on high, and his proud heart was stricken with lamentation.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.17">Now to his mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.18">first among men to seek out Nestor, the son of Neleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.19">to see if Nestor with him could work out a plan that would not fail,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.20">and one that might drive the evil away from all the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.21">He stood upright, and slipped the tunic upon his body,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.22">and underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.23">and thereafter slung across him the tawny hide of a lion</p>
	<p id="IL.10.24">glowing and huge, that swung to his feet, and took up a spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.25">So likewise trembling seized Menelaos, neither on his eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.10.26">had sweet slumber descending settled, for fear that the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.10.27">might suffer some hurt, they who for his sake over much water</p>
	<p id="IL.10.28">had come to Troy, bearing their bold attack to the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.29">First of all he mantled his broad back in a leopard's</p>
	<p id="IL.10.30">spotted hide, then lifting the circle of a brazen helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.10.31">placed it upon his head, and took up a spear in his big hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.32">and went on his way to waken his brother, who was the great king</p>
	<p id="IL.10.33">of all Argives, one honoured in his own land as a god is.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.34">He found him putting the splendid armour about his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.10.35">beside the stern of his ship, and was welcomed as he came up to him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.36">It was Menelaos of the great war cry who spoke first:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.37">'Why this arming, my brother? Is it some one of your companions</p>
	<p id="IL.10.38">you are stirring to go and spy on the Trojans? Yet I fear sadly</p>
	<p id="IL.10.39">there will not be any man to undertake this endeavour,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.40">going against enemy fighters to spy on them, alone, through</p>
	<p id="IL.10.41">the immortal night. Such a man will have to be very bold-hearted.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.42">Then in turn powerful Agamemnon answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.43">'You and I, illustrious, o Menelaos, have need now</p>
	<p id="IL.10.44">of crafty counsel, if any man is to defend and rescue</p>
	<p id="IL.10.45">the Argives and their ships, since the heart of Zeus is turned from us.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.46">For the sacrifices of Hektor have stirred his heart more than ours have.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.47">No, for I never saw nor heard from the lips of another</p>
	<p id="IL.10.48">of a single man in a day imagining so much evil</p>
	<p id="IL.10.49">as Hektor, beloved of Zeus, has wrought on the sons of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.50">alone, being called true son neither of a god nor a goddess.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.51">He has done things I think the Argives will remember with sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.10.52">long into the future, such harm has he devised the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.53">But go now, running lightly beside the ships, and call to us</p>
	<p id="IL.10.54">Idomeneus and Aias, while I shall go after Nestor</p>
	<p id="IL.10.55">the brilliant, and waken him to rise, if he might be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.56">to approach the sacred duty of the guards, or give orders to them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.57">Above all, these would listen to him, seeing that his own son</p>
	<p id="IL.10.58">commands the pickets, and with him the follower of Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.59">Meriones. To these above all we entrusted the duty.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.60">Then in turn Menelaos of the great war cry answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.61">'How then do you intend this order that you have given me?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.62">Shall I wait where I am, with them, and watch for your coming,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.63">or run after you, when I have properly given the order?'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.64">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.65">'Better wait here, so there will be no way we can miss one another</p>
	<p id="IL.10.66">as we come and go. There are many paths up and down the encampment.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.67">Call out wherever you go, and waken each man to give him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.68">your orders, naming him by descent with the name of his father.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.69">Give each man due respect. Let not your spirit be haughty,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.70">but let it be you and I ourselves who do the work, seeing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.71">that Zeus cast on us as we were born this burden of evil.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.72">So he spoke and with careful orders sent off his brother,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.73">and he himself went in search of Nestor, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.74">and came on him beside his own shelter and his own black ship</p>
	<p id="IL.10.75">in a soft bed, and his bright gear was lying beside him,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.76">the shield, and the two spears, and the glittering helmet, and by him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.77">lay in all its shining the war belt, in which the old man</p>
	<p id="IL.10.78">girt himself, when he armed for the fighting where men die, leading</p>
	<p id="IL.10.79">his own people, since he gave no ground to sorrowful old age.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.80">He straightened up and raised his head, leaning on one elbow,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.81">and spoke to the son of Atreus, and asked him a question:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.82">'Who are you, who walk alone through the ships and the army</p>
	<p id="IL.10.83">and through the darkness of night when other mortals are sleeping?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.84">Are you looking for one of your mules, or looking for some companion?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.85">Speak, do not come upon me in silence. What would you of me?'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.86">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.87">'Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.88">you will know Atreus' son Agamemnon, whom beyond others</p>
	<p id="IL.10.89">Zeus has involved in hard work forever, as long as life's wind</p>
	<p id="IL.10.90">stays in my breast, as long as my knees have their spring beneath me.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.91">I am driven thus, because the ease of sleep will not settle</p>
	<p id="IL.10.92">on my eyes, but fighting and the cares of the Achaians perplex me.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.93">Terribly I am in dread for the Danaans, nor does my pulse beat</p>
	<p id="IL.10.94">steadily, but I go distracted, and my heart is pounding</p>
	<p id="IL.10.95">through my chest, and my shining limbs are shaken beneath me.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.96">But if you are for action, since sleep comes neither upon you,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.97">let us both go out to the pickets, so that we may see</p>
	<p id="IL.10.98">if they might not have found weariness too much for them, and fallen</p>
	<p id="IL.10.99">asleep, and altogether forgotten their duty, to keep watch.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.100">There are men who hate us sitting nearby, nor do we know</p>
	<p id="IL.10.101">that they might not be pondering an attack on us in the darkness.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.102">Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.103">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.104">Zeus of the counsels, I think, will not accomplish for Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.10.105">all his designs and all he hopes for now; I think rather</p>
	<p id="IL.10.106">he will have still more hardships to wrestle, if ever Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.107">turns again the heart within him from its wearisome anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.108">Surely, I will go with you, and let us also awaken</p>
	<p id="IL.10.109">others, the son of Tydeus the spear-famed, and Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.110">and Aias the swift-footed, and the powerful son of Phyleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.111">But if one were to go also and call these others I speak of,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.112">Aias the great, the godlike one, and the lord Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.113">why, their ships lie farthest from us, and are not at all close.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.114">But, beloved as he is and respected, I will still blame</p>
	<p id="IL.10.115">Menelaos, even though you be angry, and I will not hide it,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.116">for the way he sleeps and has given to you alone all the hard work.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.117">For now he ought to be hard at work going to all the great men</p>
	<p id="IL.10.118">in supplication. This need that has come is no more endurable.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.119">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.120">'Aged sir, other times I also would tell you to blame him,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.121">since often he hangs back and is not willing to work hard,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.122">not that he shrinks from it and gives way, nor in the mind's dullness,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.123">but because he looks to me, and waits till I make a beginning.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.124">But this time he woke far before me, and came to rouse me,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.125">and I sent him on to call those you ask after. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.10.126">let us go. We shall find those others there with the sentries</p>
	<p id="IL.10.127">before the gates, where I told them to form and assemble.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.128">Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.129">'Thus no man of the Argives can disobey him nor find fault</p>
	<p id="IL.10.130">with him, whenever he stirs up any of them and gives orders.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.131">With this speech, he slipped the tunic upon his body</p>
	<p id="IL.10.132">and underneath his shining feet he bound the fair sandals,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.133">and pinned about him a great vermilion mantle sweeping</p>
	<p id="IL.10.134">in a double fold, with a thick fleece of wool upon it.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.135">Then he caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.136">and went on his way down the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.137">First he came on Odysseus, the equal of Zeus in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.138">and Nestor the Gerenian horseman wakened him from sleep,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.139">speaking aloud, and the wave of the voice swept quick through his hearing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.140">and he came forth from his shelter and called out his word to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.141">'Why do you wander thus up and down the ships and the army</p>
	<p id="IL.10.142">alone, through the immortal night? What need is upon you?'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.143">Thereupon the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.144">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.145">do not be angry; such grief has fallen upon the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.146">Come then with us to waken another, for whom it is becoming</p>
	<p id="IL.10.147">to deliberate the question of running away or of fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.148">He spoke, and resourceful Odysseus moving back into his shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.10.149">put the bright-patterned shield on his shoulders, and went on with them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.150">They went to the son of Tydeus, Diomedes, and found him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.151">with his gear outside the shelter, and his companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.152">slept with their shields underneath their heads, and their spears beside them</p>
	<p id="IL.10.153">stood upright, the heels driven deep in the ground, and the bronze afar off</p>
	<p id="IL.10.154">glared, like the lightning of Zeus father. The hero</p>
	<p id="IL.10.155">slept, with the hide of a field-ranging ox laid beneath him,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.156">but underneath his head was laid out a lustrous blanket.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.157">Nestor the Gerenian horseman stood by to waken him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.158">and roused him, stirring him with his heel, and scolded him to his face:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.159">'Son of Tydeus, wake up! Why do you doze in slumber</p>
	<p id="IL.10.160">nightlong? Do you not hear how the Trojans at the break of the flat land</p>
	<p id="IL.10.161">are sitting close to our ships, and narrow ground holds them from us?'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.162">So he spoke, and the other rapidly stirred from his sleeping</p>
	<p id="IL.10.163">and spoke winged words to him and addressed him thus: 'Aged sir,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.164">you are a hard man. You are never finished with working.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.165">Now are there not other sons of the Achaians younger than you are</p>
	<p id="IL.10.166">who could be going about everywhere to each of the princes</p>
	<p id="IL.10.167">and waking them up? But you, aged sir, are too much for us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.168">In turn Nestor the Gerenian horseman said to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.169">'Yes, dear friend, all this that you said has been fairly spoken.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.170">I myself have sons without blame, I have followers,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.171">plenty of them, of whom any could go to summon the princes.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.172">But this difficulty is very great that has come to the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.173">since for all of us the decision now stands on the edge of a razor</p>
	<p id="IL.10.174">whether the Achaians shall have life or sorry destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.175">But go now to Aias the swift and the son of Phyleus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.176">and waken them--you are younger than I--if truly you have pity.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.177">He spoke, and the other wrapped his shoulders in the hide of a lion</p>
	<p id="IL.10.178">glowing and huge, that swung to his feet, and took up a spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.179">The hero went, and waking the others brought them back with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.180">Now as these men mingled with the sentries assembling</p>
	<p id="IL.10.181">they found the leaders of the pickets by no means asleep</p>
	<p id="IL.10.182">but all of them were wide awake, and sat by their weapons.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.183">As dogs about the sheep in a yard are restless in watching</p>
	<p id="IL.10.184">as they hear a wild beast boldly moving, who through the timber</p>
	<p id="IL.10.185">goes among the mountains, and a clamour rises about him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.186">of men and of dogs, and all their sleep has been broken from them;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.187">so for these the softness of sleep was broken from their eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.10.188">as they held the bitter midwatch, since they were turning always</p>
	<p id="IL.10.189">toward the plain, where they heard the Trojans coming and going.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.190">The aged man was glad when he saw them, and with speech of good cheer</p>
	<p id="IL.10.191">spoke winged words to them and addressed them thus: 'Continue</p>
	<p id="IL.10.192">to keep your watch this way, beloved children, and let not</p>
	<p id="IL.10.193">sleep seize any, lest you become a delight to your enemies.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.194">So he spoke, and strode on through the ditch, and there followed with him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.195">the kings of the Argives, all who had been called into conclave,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.196">and with them went Meriones and Nestor's glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.10.197">son, since the kings themselves called these to take counsel with them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.198">After they had crossed the deep-dug ditch they settled</p>
	<p id="IL.10.199">on clean ground, where there showed a space not cumbered with corpses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.200">of the fallen, a place whence Hektor the huge had turned back</p>
	<p id="IL.10.201">from destroying the Argives, after the night had darkened about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.202">There they seated themselves, and opened words to each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.203">and the Gerenian horseman Nestor began speaking among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.204">'O my friends, is there no man who, trusting in the daring</p>
	<p id="IL.10.205">of his own heart, would go among the high-hearted Trojans?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.206">So he might catch some enemy, who straggled behind them,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.207">or he might overhear some thing that the Trojans are saying,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.208">what they deliberate among themselves, and whether they purpose</p>
	<p id="IL.10.209">to stay where they are, close to the ships, or else to withdraw back</p>
	<p id="IL.10.210">into their city, now that they have beaten the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.211">Could a man learn this, and then come back again to us</p>
	<p id="IL.10.212">unhurt, why huge and heaven-high would rise up his glory</p>
	<p id="IL.10.213">among all people, and an excellent gift would befall him;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.214">for all those who hold by the ships high power as princes,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.215">of all these each one of them will give him a black sheep,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.216">female, with a lamb beneath; there shall be no gift like this one,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.217">one that will be forever by at the feasts and festivals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.218">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.219">but now Diomedes of the great war cry spoke forth among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.220">'Nestor, my own heart and my own proud spirit arouse me</p>
	<p id="IL.10.221">to go into the host of the hateful men who lie near us,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.222">the Trojans; but if some other man would go along with me</p>
	<p id="IL.10.223">there would be more comfort in it, and greater confidence.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.224">When two go together, one of them at least looks forward</p>
	<p id="IL.10.225">to see what is best; a man by himself, though he be careful,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.226">still has less mind in him than two, and his wits have less weight.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.227">He spoke, and many were willing to go with Diomedes.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.228">The two Aiantes were willing, henchman of Ares, and likewise</p>
	<p id="IL.10.229">Meriones, and Nestor's son altogether willing,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.230">and Atreus' son was willing, Menelaos the spear-famed,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.231">and patient Odysseus too was willing to enter the multitude</p>
	<p id="IL.10.232">of Trojans, since forever the heart in his breast was daring.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.233">Now it was the lord of men, Agamemnon, who spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.234">'Son of Tydeus, you who delight my heart, Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.235">pick your man to be your companion, whichever you wish,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.236">the best of all who have shown, since many are eager to do it.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.237">You must not, for the awe that you feel in your heart, pass over</p>
	<p id="IL.10.238">the better man and take the worse, giving way to modesty</p>
	<p id="IL.10.239">and looking to his degree--not even if he be kinglier.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.240">So he spoke, and was frightened for Menelaos of the fair hair.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.241">But now again Diomedes of the great war cry spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.242">'If indeed you tell me myself to pick my companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.243">how then could I forget Odysseus the godlike, he whose</p>
	<p id="IL.10.244">heart and whose proud spirit are beyond all others forward</p>
	<p id="IL.10.245">in all hard endeavours, and Pallas Athene loves him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.246">Were he to go with me, both of us could come back from the blazing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.247">of fire itself, since his mind is best at devices.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.248">Then in turn long-suffering brilliant Odysseus answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.249">'Son of Tydeus, do not praise me so, nor yet blame me.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.250">These are the Argives, who know well all these matters you speak of.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.251">But let us go: for the night draws far along, and the dawn nears,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.252">the stars have gone far on their course, and the full of the night has passed by,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.253">through two portions, and the third portion is that which is left us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.254">So they spoke, and armed themselves in their weapons of terror,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.255">and Thrasymedes the stubborn in battle gave the son of Tydeus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.256">a two-edged sword (his own had been left behind by his vessel)</p>
	<p id="IL.10.257">and a shield; and he put over his head a helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.10.258">of bull's hide, with neither horn nor crest, which is known as</p>
	<p id="IL.10.259">the skull cap, and guards the heads of strong men in battle;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.260">while Meriones gave Odysseus a bow and a quiver</p>
	<p id="IL.10.261">and a sword; and he too put over his head a helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.10.262">fashioned of leather; on the inside the cap was cross-strung firmly</p>
	<p id="IL.10.263">with thongs of leather, and on the outer side the white teeth</p>
	<p id="IL.10.264">of a tusk-shining boar were close sewn one after another</p>
	<p id="IL.10.265">with craftsmanship and skill; and a felt was set in the centre.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.266">Autolykos, breaking into the close-built house, had stolen it</p>
	<p id="IL.10.267">from Amyntor, the son of Ormenos, out of Eleon,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.268">and gave it to Kytherian Amphidamas, at Skandeia;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.269">Amphidamas gave it in turn to Molos, a gift of guest-friendship,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.270">and Molos gave it to his son Meriones to carry.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.271">But at this time it was worn to cover the head of Odysseus.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.272">When these two had armed themselves in their weapons of terror</p>
	<p id="IL.10.273">they went on their way, and left behind there all the princes,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.274">and on the right near the way they were taking Pallas Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.10.275">sent down a heron to them; indeed, their eyes could not see it</p>
	<p id="IL.10.276">through the darkness of night, but they could hear it crying.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.277">And Odysseus was glad at the bird-sign, and prayed to Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.278">'Hear me, daughter of Zeus of the aegis, you who forever</p>
	<p id="IL.10.279">stand beside me in all hard tasks, nor am I forgotten</p>
	<p id="IL.10.280">as I go my ways: now give me the best of your love, Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.281">and grant that we come back in glory to the strong-benched vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.10.282">when we have done a great thing that will sadden the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.283">Diomedes of the great war cry spoke in prayer after him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.284">'Hear me also, Atrytone, daughter of great Zeus.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.285">Come with me now as you went with my father, brilliant Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.286">into Thebes, when he went with a message before the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.287">and left the bronze-armoured Achaians beside Asopos</p>
	<p id="IL.10.288">while he carried a word of friendship to the Kadmeians</p>
	<p id="IL.10.289">in that place; but on his way back he was minded to grim deeds</p>
	<p id="IL.10.290">with your aid, divine goddess, since you stood in goodwill beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.291">So now again be willing to stand by me, and watch over me,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.292">and I in turn will dedicate you a heifer, broad-browed,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.293">one year old, unbroken, that no man ever led under</p>
	<p id="IL.10.294">the yoke. I will drench her horns in gold and offer her to you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.295">So they spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.296">Then, after they had made their prayers to the daughter of great Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.297">they went on their way like two lions into the black night</p>
	<p id="IL.10.298">through the carnage and through the corpses, war gear and dark blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.299">Nor did Hektor either permit the high-hearted Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.10.300">to sleep, but had called together in a group all of their great men,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.301">those who were the leaders of Troy and their men of deliberation.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.302">Summoning these he compacted before them his close counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.303">'Who would take upon him this work and bring it to fulfilment</p>
	<p id="IL.10.304">for a huge price? The reward will be one that will suffice him;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.305">for I will give a chariot and two strong-necked horses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.306">who are the finest of all beside the fast ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.10.307">to him who has the daring, winning honour for himself also,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.308">to go close to the swift-running ships and find out for us</p>
	<p id="IL.10.309">whether the swift ships are guarded, as they were before this,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.310">or whether now the Achaians who are beaten under our hands</p>
	<p id="IL.10.311">are planning flight among themselves, and no longer are willing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.312">to guard them by night, now that stark weariness has broken them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.313">So he spoke, and all of them were stricken to silence.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.314">But there was one among the Trojans, Dolon, Eumedes'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.315">son, the sacred herald's, a man of much gold and much bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.316">He was an evil man to look on, but was swift-footed;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.317">moreover he was a single son among five sisters.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.318">This man now spoke his word before the Trojans and Hektor:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.319">'Hektor, my own heart and my proud spirit arouse me</p>
	<p id="IL.10.320">to go close to the swift-running ships and to learn about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.321">Come then, hold up your sceptre before me, and swear upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.10.322">that you will give me the horses, and the chariot made bright</p>
	<p id="IL.10.323">with bronze, that carry the blameless son of Peleus. I shall not</p>
	<p id="IL.10.324">be a vain spy for you, nor less than your expectation,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.325">for I shall go straight on through their army, until I come to</p>
	<p id="IL.10.326">the ship of Agamemnon, where their greatest men must be gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.10.327">to deliberate the question of running away or of fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.328">He spoke, and Hektor took the staff in his hand, and swore to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.329">'Let Zeus, loud-thundering lord of Hera, now be my witness</p>
	<p id="IL.10.330">himself, that no other man of the Trojans shall mount these horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.331">since I say they shall be utterly yours, and your glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.332">He spoke, and swore to an empty oath, and stirred the man onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.333">And at once Dolon cast across his shoulders the bent bow.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.334">He put on about him the pelt of a grey wolf, and on his head set</p>
	<p id="IL.10.335">a cap of marten's hide, and took up a sharp throwing spear</p>
	<p id="IL.10.336">and went on his way toward the ships from his own camp, nor was he ever</p>
	<p id="IL.10.337">to come back again from the ships, and carry his word to Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.338">Now when he had left behind the throng of men and of horses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.339">he went on his way, eagerly, but illustrious Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.340">was aware of him coming and spoke to Diomedes:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.341">'This is some man, Diomedes, on his way from the army.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.342">I do not know whether he comes to spy on our vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.10.343">or to strip some one of the perished corpses, but we must let him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.344">first go on past us a little way in the open</p>
	<p id="IL.10.345">and afterwards we will make a rush and fasten upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.346">suddenly. But if in the speed of his feet he eludes us</p>
	<p id="IL.10.347">then keep him crowded upon the ships, and away from the army</p>
	<p id="IL.10.348">always, feinting with the spear, nor let him escape to the city.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.349">So they spoke, and bent aside from their way, through the corpses,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.350">while he in the thoughtlessness of his heart ran swiftly by them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.351">But when he was gone from them as far as the range of a plough yoke</p>
	<p id="IL.10.352">of mules, since these are better beasts than oxen for dragging</p>
	<p id="IL.10.353">the wrought ploughshare through the depth of the harvest land, these two</p>
	<p id="IL.10.354">ran after him, and he heard the thudding of their feet and stopped still.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.355">He thought in his heart these would be friends from among the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.10.356">to turn him back, and that Hektor had sped them to summon him again.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.357">But when they got to a spear's throw from him, or less even,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.358">he saw that these were enemy men, and moved his knees rapidly</p>
	<p id="IL.10.359">to run away, and these set out in rapid chase of him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.360">And, as when two rip-fanged hounds have sighted a wild beast,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.361">a young deer, or a hare, and go after it, eagerly always</p>
	<p id="IL.10.362">through the spaces of the woods, and the chase runs crying before them,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.363">so the son of Tydeus, and Odysseus, sacker of cities,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.364">kept always hard on his heels and cut him off from his people.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.365">But when he was on the point of reaching the Achaian pickets,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.366">as he fled toward the vessels, then Athene put great power</p>
	<p id="IL.10.367">in Tydeus' son, so that no other bronze-armoured Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.10.368">might win the glory of striking him down, and he come in second.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.369">Powerful Diomedes threatening with the spear spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.370">'Either wait, or my spear will catch you. I think that you will not</p>
	<p id="IL.10.371">thus get clear from my hands for long, and sudden destruction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.372">He spoke, and let fly with his spear, but missed, on purpose,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.373">his man, as the point of the polished spear went over his right shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.10.374">and stuck fast in the earth. And Dolon stood still in terror</p>
	<p id="IL.10.375">gibbering, as through his mouth came the sound of his teeth's chatter</p>
	<p id="IL.10.376">in green fear; and these two, breathing hard, came up to him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.377">and caught him by the hands, and he broke into tears and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.378">'Take me alive, and I will pay my ransom: in my house</p>
	<p id="IL.10.379">there is bronze, and gold, and difficultly wrought iron,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.380">and my father would make you glad with abundant ransom</p>
	<p id="IL.10.381">were he to hear that I am alive by the ships of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.382">Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn, and answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.383">'Do not fear, and let no thought of death be upon you.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.384">But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.385">where is it that you walk alone to the ships from the army</p>
	<p id="IL.10.386">through the darkness of night when other mortals are sleeping?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.387">Is it to strip some one of the perished corpses, or is it</p>
	<p id="IL.10.388">that Hektor sent you out to spy with care upon each thing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.389">beside our hollow ships? Or did your own spirit drive you?'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.390">Then Dolon answered him, but his legs were shaking beneath him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.391">'Hektor has led my mind astray with many deceptions.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.392">He promised me the single-foot horses of proud Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.393">Peleus' son, and the chariot bright with bronze, for my gift,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.394">and gave me an order, to go through the running black night,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.395">and get close to the enemy men, and find out for him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.396">whether the swift ships are guarded, as they were before this,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.397">or whether now the Achaians who are broken under our hands</p>
	<p id="IL.10.398">are planning flight among themselves, and no longer are willing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.399">to guard them by night, now that stark weariness has broken them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.400">Then Odysseus the resourceful smiled and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.401">'Surely now, these were mighty gifts that your heart longed after,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.402">the horses of valiant Aiakides. They are difficult horses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.403">for mortal men to manage, or even to ride behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.10.404">for all except Achilleus, who was born of an immortal mother.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.405">But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.406">Where did you leave Hektor, the people's shepherd, when you came here?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.407">Where is his gear of war lying? Where are his horses?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.408">How are the rest of the Trojans disposed, the guards and the sleepers?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.409">What do they deliberate among themselves? Do they purpose</p>
	<p id="IL.10.410">to stay where they are, close to the ships? Or else to withdraw back</p>
	<p id="IL.10.411">into the city, now that they have beaten the Achaians?'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.412">Then in turn Dolon the son of Eumedes spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.413">'See, I will accurately recite all these things to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.414">Hektor is now among those who are the men of counsel</p>
	<p id="IL.10.415">and they hold their deliberations by the barrow of godlike Ilos</p>
	<p id="IL.10.416">apart from the confusion. But those guards that you ask of, hero--</p>
	<p id="IL.10.417">there is no detail that protects the army and guards it.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.418">As for the watchfire hearths of the Trojans, those who must do it</p>
	<p id="IL.10.419">keep awake by the fires and pass on the picket duty</p>
	<p id="IL.10.420">to each other, but their far-assembled companions in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.10.421">are sleeping, and pass on to the Trojans the duty of watching,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.422">since their own children do not lie nearby, nor their women.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.423">Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn, and answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.424">'How, then, are these sleeping? And are they mixed with the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.425">breakers of horses, or apart? Tell me, so I may be clear.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.426">Then in turn Dolon the son of Eumedes answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.427">'See, I will accurately recite all these things to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.428">Next the sea are the Karians, and Paionians with their curved bows,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.429">the Leleges and Kaukonians and the brilliant Pelasgians.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.430">By Thymbre are stationed the Lykians and the proud Mysians</p>
	<p id="IL.10.431">with the Phrygians who fight from horses, and Maionians, lords of chariots.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.432">But why do you question me on all this, each thing in detail?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.433">For if you are minded to get among the mass of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.434">here are the Thracians, new come, separate, beyond all others</p>
	<p id="IL.10.435">in place, and among them Rhesos their king, the son of Eïoneus.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.436">And his are the finest horses I ever saw, and the biggest;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.437">they are whiter than snow, and their speed of foot is the winds' speed;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.438">his chariot is fairly ornate with gold and with silver,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.439">and the armour is golden and gigantic, a wonder to look on,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.440">that he brought here with him. It is not like armour for mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.10.441">men to carry, but for the immortal gods. And therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.10.442">take me with you to some place by the fast-running vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.443">or else tie me fast here in a pitiless bond, and leave me,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.444">until you can make your venture, and try out the truth of my story,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.445">whether I have told you this fairly, or whether I have not.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.446">But powerful Diomedes looked darkly at him and spoke then:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.447">'Do not, Dolon, have in your mind any thought of escape</p>
	<p id="IL.10.448">now you have got in our hands, though you brought us an excellent message.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.449">For if we let you get away now, or set you free, later</p>
	<p id="IL.10.450">you will come back again to the fast ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.10.451">either to spy on us once more, or to fight strongly with us.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.452">But if, beaten down under my hands, you lose your life now,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.453">then you will nevermore be an affliction upon the Argives.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.454">He spoke, and the man was trying to reach his chin with his strong hand</p>
	<p id="IL.10.455">and cling, and supplicate him, but he struck the middle of his neck</p>
	<p id="IL.10.456">with a sweep of the sword, and slashed clean through both tendons,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.457">and Dolon's head still speaking dropped in the dust. They took off</p>
	<p id="IL.10.458">his cap of marten's hide from his head, and stripped off also</p>
	<p id="IL.10.459">the wolf's pelt, and the back-strung bow, and the long spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.460">Brilliant Odysseus held these up to Athene the Spoiler</p>
	<p id="IL.10.461">high in his hand, and spoke a word, and prayed to Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.462">'Hail, goddess. These are yours. To you first of all the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.10.463">on Olympos we will give your due share. Only guide us</p>
	<p id="IL.10.464">once again to where the Thracians sleep, and their horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.465">So he spoke, and lifting the spoils high from him he placed them</p>
	<p id="IL.10.466">upon a tamarisk bush, and piled a clear landmark beside them,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.467">pulling reeds together and the long branches of tamarisk</p>
	<p id="IL.10.468">that they might not miss them on their way back through the running black night.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.469">These two went ahead on their way through war gear and dark blood</p>
	<p id="IL.10.470">and came suddenly to the Thracians for whom they were looking.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.471">These were asleep, worn out with weariness, and their armour</p>
	<p id="IL.10.472">lay in splendour and good order on the ground beside them</p>
	<p id="IL.10.473">in three rows, and beside each man stood his team of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.474">Rhesos slept in the centre with his fast horses about him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.475">tethered by the reins to the outer rail of the chariot. Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.476">was the first to see him and pointed him out to Diomedes:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.477">'Here is our man, see, Diomedes, and here are his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.478">those that Dolon, the man we killed, pointed out to us.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.479">Come then, put forward your great strength. Here is no matter</p>
	<p id="IL.10.480">for standing by idle in your weapons. Untie the horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.481">or else let me look after them, while you kill the people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.482">He spoke, and grey-eyed Athene breathed strength into Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.10.483">and he began to kill them one after another. Grim sounds rose</p>
	<p id="IL.10.484">from there as they were stricken with the sword, and the ground reddened with blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.485">As a lion advancing on the helpless herds unshepherded</p>
	<p id="IL.10.486">of sheep or goats pounces upon them with wicked intention,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.487">so the son of Tydeus attacked the Thracian people</p>
	<p id="IL.10.488">until he had killed twelve. Meanwhile resourceful Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.10.489">as Tydeus' son stood over each man with the sword, and struck him,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.490">would catch each dead man by the foot from behind, and drag him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.491">away, with this thought in his mind, that the bright-maned horses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.492">might pass easily through and not be shaken within them</p>
	<p id="IL.10.493">at stepping on dead men. These horses were not yet used to them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.494">But when the son of Tydeus came to the king, and this was</p>
	<p id="IL.10.495">the thirteenth man, he stripped the sweetness of life from him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.496">as he lay heavily breathing--since a bad dream stood by his head</p>
	<p id="IL.10.497">in the night--no dream, but Oineus' son, by device of Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.498">Meanwhile patient Odysseus was untying the single-foot horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.499">and pulled them together with the reins, and drove them from the confusion</p>
	<p id="IL.10.500">and whipped them with his bow, since he had not noticed nor taken</p>
	<p id="IL.10.501">in his hands the glittering whip that was in the elaborate chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.502">He whistled to brilliant Diomedes as a signal to him.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.503">But he waited, divided in his mind as to what he would best do,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.504">whether to seize the chariot, wherein lay the bright armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.505">and draw it away by the pole, or lift it and carry it off with him,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.506">or strip the life from still more of the Thracians. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.10.507">as he was pondering all this in his heart, Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.10.508">came and stood beside him, and spoke to great Diomedes:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.509">'Think now, son of great-hearted Tydeus, of getting back</p>
	<p id="IL.10.510">to the hollow ships; else you might go back with men pursuing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.511">if there should be some other god to waken the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.512">So she spoke, and he knew the voice of the goddess speaking</p>
	<p id="IL.10.513">and lightly mounted behind the horses. Odysseus whipped them</p>
	<p id="IL.10.514">with his bow, and they ran for the rapid ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.515">Neither did Apollo of the silver bow keep blind watch,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.516">since he saw Athene attending the son of Tydeus. Angered</p>
	<p id="IL.10.517">with her he plunged into the great multitude of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.10.518">and roused a man of counsel among the Thracians, Hippokoön</p>
	<p id="IL.10.519">the lordly cousin of Rhesos; and he, starting out of his sleep,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.520">when he saw the place left empty where the fast horses had been standing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.521">and his men in the shambles of slaughter gasping their lives out,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.522">he groaned, and called aloud by name his beloved companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.523">And a clamour rose up from the Trojans and a vast turmoil</p>
	<p id="IL.10.524">as they swept together in confusion and stared at the ghastly work done</p>
	<p id="IL.10.525">by these two men, before they went back to their hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.526">But when these had come back to the place where they killed Hektor's scout,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.527">Odysseus beloved of Zeus reined in his running horses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.528">while Tydeus' son leaping to the ground took the bloody war spoils</p>
	<p id="IL.10.529">and handed them to Odysseus, and got up behind the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.530">Odysseus lashed them on, and they winged their way unreluctant</p>
	<p id="IL.10.531">back to the hollow ships, since this was the way he desired it.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.532">Nestor was the first to hear their thunder, and spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.533">'Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.534">shall I be wrong, or am I speaking the truth? My heart tells me.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.535">The thunder is beating against my ears of fast-running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.536">Might this only be Odysseus and strong Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.10.537">driving rapidly away from the Trojans their single-foot horses!</p>
	<p id="IL.10.538">Yet terribly I fear in my heart that these bravest Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.10.539">might have suffered some disaster from the loud host of the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.540">Yet he had not spoken all his words, and they came. The two men</p>
	<p id="IL.10.541">dismounted to the ground, and their companions rejoicing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.542">congratulated them with clasped hands and with words of welcome.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.543">First to question them was the Gerenian horseman, Nestor:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.544">'Come, tell me, honoured Odysseus, great glory of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.545">how did you win these horses? Did you go into the great company</p>
	<p id="IL.10.546">of the Trojans, or did some god meet you and give them to you?</p>
	<p id="IL.10.547">They shine, like the rays of the sun, terribly. Yet over and over</p>
	<p id="IL.10.548">I encounter the Trojans, I say that I am not at all one</p>
	<p id="IL.10.549">to hang back beside the ships, though I am an aged fighter.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.550">Yet I have never seen horses like these, nor laid eyes upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.551">I think it must be some god who met you, and gave them to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.552">Since both of you are beloved to Zeus who gathers the clouds, both</p>
	<p id="IL.10.553">to the grey-eyed maiden of Zeus who wears the aegis, Athene.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.554">Then resourceful Odysseus spoke in turn and answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.555">'Son of Neleus, Nestor, great glory of the Achaians:</p>
	<p id="IL.10.556">lightly a god, if he wished, could give us horses even better</p>
	<p id="IL.10.557">than these, seeing that the gods are far stronger than we are.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.558">These horses, aged sir, that you ask about are newcomers</p>
	<p id="IL.10.559">from Thrace, and as for their master brave Diomedes killed him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.560">and at his side killed twelve companions, all of them great men;</p>
	<p id="IL.10.561">our thirteenth man killed was their scout, here by the vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.562">one whom Hektor and the rest of the haughty Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.10.563">had sent out between the lines to spy on our army.'</p>
	<p id="IL.10.564">He spoke, and guided across the ditch the single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.10.565">laughing aloud, and the rest of the Achaians went with him</p>
	<p id="IL.10.566">rejoicing. When they came to Diomedes' strong-fashioned shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.10.567">there they tied up the horses by the carefully cut reins</p>
	<p id="IL.10.568">by the horse trough where already the horses of Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.10.569">were standing, rapid of foot, and eating their welcome provender.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.570">And by the stern of the ship Odysseus laid down the bloody</p>
	<p id="IL.10.571">battle spoils of Dolon, to dedicate to Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.10.572">And the men themselves waded into the sea and washed off</p>
	<p id="IL.10.573">the dense sweat from shin and shoulder and thigh. Afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.10.574">when the surf of the sea had rinsed the dense-running sweat away</p>
	<p id="IL.10.575">from all their skin, and the inward heart had been cooled to refreshment,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.576">they stepped into the bathtubs smooth-polished, and bathed there,</p>
	<p id="IL.10.577">and after they had bathed and anointed themselves with olive oil</p>
	<p id="IL.10.578">they sat down to dine, and from the full mixing-bowl drawing</p>
	<p id="IL.10.579">the sweet-hearted wine poured out an offering to Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.1">Now Dawn rose from her bed, where she lay by haughty Tithonos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.2">to carry her light to men and to immortals. Zeus sent down</p>
	<p id="IL.11.3">in speed to the fast ships of the Achaians the wearisome goddess</p>
	<p id="IL.11.4">of Hate, holding in her hands the portent of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.5">She took her place on the huge-hollowed black ship of Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.6">which lay in the middle, so that she could cry out to both flanks,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.7">either as far as the shelters of Telamonian Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.11.8">or to those of Achilleus; since these had hauled their balanced ships up</p>
	<p id="IL.11.9">at the ends, certain of their manhood and their hands' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.10">There the goddess took her place, and cried out a great cry</p>
	<p id="IL.11.11">and terrible and loud, and put strength in all the Achaians'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.12">hearts, to go on tirelessly with their fighting of battles.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.13">And now battle became sweeter to them than to go back</p>
	<p id="IL.11.14">in their hollow ships to the beloved land of their fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.15">And Atreus' son cried out aloud and drove the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.16">to gird them, while he himself put the shining bronze upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.17">First he placed along his legs the beautiful greaves linked</p>
	<p id="IL.11.18">with silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.19">Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet</p>
	<p id="IL.11.20">that Kinyras had given him once, to be a guest present.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.21">For the great fame and rumour of war had carried to Kypros</p>
	<p id="IL.11.22">how the Achaians were to sail against Troy in their vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.23">Therefore he gave the king as a gift of grace this corselet.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.24">Now there were ten circles of deep cobalt upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.25">and twelve of gold and twenty of tin. And toward the opening</p>
	<p id="IL.11.26">at the throat there were rearing up three serpents of cobalt</p>
	<p id="IL.11.27">on either side, like rainbows, which the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.28">has marked upon the clouds, to be a portent to mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.29">Across his shoulders he slung the sword, and the nails upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.30">were golden and glittered, and closing about it the scabbard</p>
	<p id="IL.11.31">was silver, and gold was upon the swordstraps that held it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.32">And he took up the man-enclosing elaborate stark shield,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.33">a thing of splendour. There were ten circles of bronze upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.34">and set about it were twenty knobs of tin, pale-shining,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.35">and in the very centre another knob of dark cobalt.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.36">And circled in the midst of all was the blank-eyed face of the Gorgon</p>
	<p id="IL.11.37">with her stare of horror, and Fear was inscribed upon it, and Terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.38">The strap of the shield had silver upon it, and there also on it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.39">was coiled a cobalt snake, and there were three heads upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.40">twisted to look backward and grown from a single neck, all three.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.41">Upon his head he set the helmet, two-horned, four-sheeted,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.42">with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.43">Then he caught up two strong spears edged with sharp bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.11.44">and the brazen heads flashed far from him deep into heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.45">And Hera and Athene caused a crash of thunder about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.46">doing honour to the lord of deep-golden Mykenai.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.47">Thereupon each man gave orders to his charioteer</p>
	<p id="IL.11.48">to rein in the horses once again by the ditch, in good order,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.49">while they themselves, dismounted and armed in their war gear, swept onward</p>
	<p id="IL.11.50">to the ditch, and their incessant clamour rose up in the morning.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.51">In battle array they came to the ditch well ahead of the horseman</p>
	<p id="IL.11.52">and the horseman followed a little behind. And the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.53">drove down the evil turmoil upon them, and from aloft cast</p>
	<p id="IL.11.54">down dews dripping blood from the sky, since he was minded</p>
	<p id="IL.11.55">to hurl down a multitude of strong heads to the house of Hades.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.56">On the other side of the ditch at the break of the plain the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.57">gathered about tall Hektor and stately Poulydamas</p>
	<p id="IL.11.58">and Aineias, honoured by Trojans in their countryside as a god is,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.59">and the three sons of Antenor, Polybos, and brilliant Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.60">and Akamas, a young man still, in the likeness of the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.61">And Hektor carried the perfect circle of his shield in the foremost,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.62">as among the darkened clouds the bale star shows forth</p>
	<p id="IL.11.63">in all shining, then merges again in the clouds and the darkness.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.64">So Hektor would at one time be shining among the foremost,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.65">and then once more urging on the last, and complete in bronze armour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.66">glittered like the thunder-flash of Zeus of the aegis, our father.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.67">And the men, like two lines of reapers who, facing each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.68">drive their course all down the field of wheat or of barley</p>
	<p id="IL.11.69">for a man blessed in substance, and the cut swathes drop showering,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.70">so Trojans and Achaians driving in against one another</p>
	<p id="IL.11.71">cut men down, nor did either side think of disastrous panic.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.72">The pressure held their heads on a line, and they whirled and fought like</p>
	<p id="IL.11.73">wolves, and Hate, the Lady of Sorrow, was gladdened to watch them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.74">She alone of all the immortals attended this action</p>
	<p id="IL.11.75">but the other immortals were not there, but sat quietly</p>
	<p id="IL.11.76">remote and apart in their palaces, where for each one of them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.77">a house had been built in splendour along the folds of Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.78">All were blaming the son of Kronos, Zeus of the dark mists,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.79">because his will was to give glory to the Trojans. To these gods</p>
	<p id="IL.11.80">the father gave no attention at all, but withdrawn from them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.81">and rejoicing in the pride of his strength sat apart from the others</p>
	<p id="IL.11.82">looking out over the city of Troy and the ships of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.83">watching the flash of the bronze, and men killing and men killed.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.84">So long as it was early morning and the sacred daylight increasing,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.85">so long the thrown weapons of both took hold and men dropped under them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.86">But at that time when the woodcutter makes ready his supper</p>
	<p id="IL.11.87">in the wooded glens of the mountains, when his arms and hands have grown weary</p>
	<p id="IL.11.88">from cutting down the tall trees, and his heart has had enough of it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.89">and longing for food and for sweet wine takes hold of his senses;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.90">at that time the Danaans by their manhood broke the battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.11.91">calling across the ranks to each other. First Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.11.92">drove on, and killed a man, Bienor, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.93">himself, then his companion Oïleus, lasher of horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.94">who, springing down from behind his horses, stood forth to face him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.95">but Agamemnon stabbed straight at his face as he came on in fury</p>
	<p id="IL.11.96">with the sharp spear, nor did helm's bronze-heavy edge hold it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.97">but the spearhead passed through this and the bone, and the inward</p>
	<p id="IL.11.98">brain was all spattered forth. So he beat him down in his fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.99">and Agamemnon the lord of men left them lying there</p>
	<p id="IL.11.100">and their white bodies showing, since he had stripped off their tunics.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.101">Then he went on to kill and strip Isos and Antiphos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.102">two sons of Priam, bastard one and one lawful, both riding</p>
	<p id="IL.11.103">in a single chariot. The bastard, Isos, was charioteer</p>
	<p id="IL.11.104">and renowned Antiphos rode beside him. Before this Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.105">had caught these two at the knees of Ida, and bound them in pliant</p>
	<p id="IL.11.106">willows as they watched by their sheep, and released them for ransom.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.107">This time the son of Atreus, wide-powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.108">struck Isos with the thrown spear in the chest above the nipple</p>
	<p id="IL.11.109">and hit Antiphos by the ear with the sword and hurled him from his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.110">and in eager haste he stripped off from these their glorious armour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.111">which he knew; he had seen these two before by the fast ships</p>
	<p id="IL.11.112">when Achilleus of the swift feet had brought them in from Ida.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.113">And as a lion seizes the innocent young of the running</p>
	<p id="IL.11.114">deer, and easily crunches and breaks them caught in the strong teeth</p>
	<p id="IL.11.115">when he has invaded their lair, and rips out the soft heart from them,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.116">and even if the doe be very near, still she has no strength</p>
	<p id="IL.11.117">to help, for the ghastly shivers of fear are upon her also</p>
	<p id="IL.11.118">and suddenly she dashes away through the glades and the timber</p>
	<p id="IL.11.119">sweating in her speed away from the pounce of the strong beast;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.120">so there was no one of the Trojans who could save these two</p>
	<p id="IL.11.121">from death, but they themselves were running in fear from the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.122">Next he caught Peisandros and Hippolochos stubborn in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.123">sons of Antimachos the wise, who beyond all others</p>
	<p id="IL.11.124">had taken the gold of Alexandros, glorious gifts, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.11.125">he had opposed the return of Helen to fair-haired Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.126">Powerful Agamemnon caught his two sons riding</p>
	<p id="IL.11.127">in one chariot, who together guided the running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.128">Now the glittering reins escaped from the hands of both of them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.129">and they were stunned with fear, for against them rose like a lion</p>
	<p id="IL.11.130">Atreus' son, and they supplicated him out of the chariot:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.131">'Take us alive, son of Atreus, and take appropriate ransom.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.132">In the house of Antimachos the treasures lie piled in abundance,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.133">bronze is there, and gold, and difficultly wrought iron,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.134">and our father would make you glad with abundant repayment</p>
	<p id="IL.11.135">were he to hear we were alive by the ships of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.136">Thus these two cried out upon the king, lamenting</p>
	<p id="IL.11.137">and in pitiful phrase, but they heard the voice that was without pity:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.138">'If in truth you are the sons of wise Antimachos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.139">that man who once among the Trojans assembled advised them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.140">that Menelaos, who came as envoy with godlike Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.141">should be murdered on the spot nor let go back to the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.142">so now your mutilation shall punish the shame of your father.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.143">He spoke, and spurned Peisandros to the ground from the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.11.144">with a spear-stroke in the chest, and he crashed on his back to the ground. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.11.145">Hippolochos sprang away, but Atreides killed him dismounted,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.146">cutting away his arms with a sword-stroke, free of the shoulder,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.147">and sent him spinning like a log down the battle. Thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.11.148">he left them, and toward that place where the most battalions were shaken</p>
	<p id="IL.11.149">drove, and beside him drove the rest of the strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.150">and footmen killed footmen who fled under strong compulsion</p>
	<p id="IL.11.151">and riders killed riders, and a storm of dust rose up under them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.152">out of the plain uplifted by the thundering feet of their horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.153">They killed with the bronze, and among them powerful Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.11.154">went onward always slaying and urged on the rest of the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.155">As when obliterating fire comes down on the timbered forest</p>
	<p id="IL.11.156">and the roll of the wind carries it everywhere, and bushes</p>
	<p id="IL.11.157">leaning under the force of the fire's rush tumble uprooted,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.158">so before Atreus' son Agamemnon went down the high heads</p>
	<p id="IL.11.159">of the running Trojans, and in many places the strong-necked horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.160">rattled their empty chariots along the causeways of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.161">and longed for their haughty charioteers, who were lying</p>
	<p id="IL.11.162">along the ground, to delight no longer their wives, but the vultures.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.163">But Zeus drew Hektor out from under the dust and the missiles,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.164">out of the place where men were killed, the blood and confusion,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.165">while Atreides followed urging the Danaans forever onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.166">The Trojans swept in their flight past the barrow of ancient Ilos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.167">Dardanos' son, to the centre of the level ground and the fig tree,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.168">as they made for the city, and he followed them always, screaming,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.169">Atreus' son, his invincible hands spattered with bloody filth.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.170">But when they had made their way to the Skaian gates and the oak tree</p>
	<p id="IL.11.171">the Trojans stood their ground, and each side endured the other,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.172">while others still in the middle plain stampeded like cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.11.173">when a lion, coming upon them in the dim night, has terrified</p>
	<p id="IL.11.174">the whole herd, while for a single one sheer death is emerging.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.175">First the lion breaks her neck caught fast in the strong teeth,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.176">then gulps down the blood and all the guts that are inward;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.177">so Atreus' son, powerful Agamemnon, went after them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.178">killing ever the last of the men; and they fled in terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.179">Many were hurled from behind their horses, face downward or sprawling</p>
	<p id="IL.11.180">under the hands of Atreides who raged with his spear in the forefront.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.181">But when he was on the point of making his way to the city</p>
	<p id="IL.11.182">and the steep wall, the father of gods and of men descending</p>
	<p id="IL.11.183">out of the sky took his place along the ridges of Ida</p>
	<p id="IL.11.184">of the fountains, and held fast in his hands the thunderbolt.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.185">He sent on her way Iris of the golden wings with a message:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.186">'Go on your way, swift Iris, and carry my word to Hektor:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.187">as long as he beholds Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.188">raging among the champions and cutting down the ranged fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.189">so long let him hold back and urge on the rest of his people</p>
	<p id="IL.11.190">to fight against the enemy through this strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.191">But when, either struck with a spear or hit by a flying arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.192">he springs up behind his horses, then I guarantee power to Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.11.193">to kill men, till he makes his way to the strong-benched vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.194">until the sun goes down and the blessed darkness comes over.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.195">He spoke, and swift wind-footed Iris did not disobey him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.196">but went down along the hills of Ida to sacred Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.197">and found the son of wise Priam, Hektor the brilliant,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.198">standing among the compacted chariots and by the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.199">Iris the swift of foot came close beside and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.200">'Hektor, o son of Priam and equal of Zeus in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.201">Zeus my father has sent me down to tell you this message.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.202">As long as you behold Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.203">raging among the champions and cutting down the ranged fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.204">so long hold back from the fighting, but urge on the rest of your people</p>
	<p id="IL.11.205">to fight against the enemy through this strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.206">But when, either struck with a spear or hit by a flying arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.207">he springs up behind his horses, then Zeus guarantees power to you</p>
	<p id="IL.11.208">to kill men, till you make your way to the strong-benched vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.209">until the sun goes down and the blessed darkness comes over.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.210">Swift-foot Iris spoke to him thus and went away from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.211">and Hektor in all his armour leapt to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.11.212">and shaking two sharp spears in his hand ranged over the whole host</p>
	<p id="IL.11.213">stirring them up to fight and waking the ghastly warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.214">So they whirled about and stood their ground against the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.215">and the Argives against them pulled together their battle lines.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.216">So the fighting grew close and they faced each other, and foremost</p>
	<p id="IL.11.217">Agamemnon drove on, trying to fight far ahead of all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.218">Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.219">who was the first to come forth and stand against Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.11.220">of the very Trojans, or their renowned companions in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.221">Iphidamas, Antenor's son, the huge and stalwart</p>
	<p id="IL.11.222">who had been reared in generous Thrace, the mother of sheepflocks.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.223">Kisseus had raised him in his own house when he was little,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.224">his mother's father, whose child was Theano, the girl of the fair cheeks.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.225">But when he had arrived at the stature of powerful manhood</p>
	<p id="IL.11.226">Kisseus detained him there and gave him his daughter. Married</p>
	<p id="IL.11.227">he went away from the bride chamber, looking for glory</p>
	<p id="IL.11.228">from the Achaians, with twelve curved ships that followed with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.229">These balanced vessels he had left behind in Perkote</p>
	<p id="IL.11.230">and gone himself to fight on foot at Ilion; and there</p>
	<p id="IL.11.231">he came face to face with Atreus' son, Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.232">Now when these in their advance were close to each other</p>
	<p id="IL.11.233">the son of Atreus missed with his throw, and the spear was turned past him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.234">but Iphidamas stabbed to the belt underneath the corselet</p>
	<p id="IL.11.235">and leaned in on the stroke in the confidence of his strong hand</p>
	<p id="IL.11.236">but could not get clean through the bright war belt, far sooner</p>
	<p id="IL.11.237">the spearpoint pushed against the silver bent back, like soft lead.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.238">And in his hand wide-powerful Agamemnon catching it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.239">dragged it against him, raging like a lion, and tore it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.240">out of his hand, then struck the neck with his sword, and unstrung him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.241">So Iphidamas fell there and went into the brazen slumber,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.242">unhappy, who came to help his own people, and left his young wife</p>
	<p id="IL.11.243">a bride, and had known no delight from her yet, and given much for her.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.244">First he had given a hundred oxen, then promised a thousand</p>
	<p id="IL.11.245">head of goats and sheep, which were herded for him in abundance.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.246">Now Agamemnon, son of Atreus, stripped him and went back</p>
	<p id="IL.11.247">to the throng of the Achaians bearing the splendid armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.248">When Koön, conspicuous among the fighters, perceived him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.249">he who was Antenor's eldest born, the strong sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.11.250">misted about his eyes for the sake of his fallen brother.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.251">He came from the side and unobserved at great Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.11.252">and stabbed with his spear at the middle arm, underneath the elbow,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.253">and the head of the glittering spear cut its way clean through.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.254">Agamemnon the lord of men shuddered with fear then</p>
	<p id="IL.11.255">but even so did not give up the attack or his fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.11.256">but sprang at Koön, gripping a spear that struck with the wind's speed.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.257">Now Koön was dragging his father's son, his brother Iphidamas,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.258">by the foot back eagerly, and cried out on all the bravest,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.259">but as he dragged him into the crowd, Agamemnon thrust at him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.260">with the smoothed bronze spear underneath the knobbed shield, and unstrung him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.261">then came up and hewed off his head over Iphidamas.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.262">There under the king, Atreus' son, the sons of Antenor</p>
	<p id="IL.11.263">filled out their destiny and went down to the house of the death god.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.264">But Agamemnon ranged the ranks of the other fighters</p>
	<p id="IL.11.265">with spear and sword and with huge stones that he flung, for such time</p>
	<p id="IL.11.266">as the blood was still running warm from the spear-wound.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.267">But after the sore place was dry, and the flow of blood stopped,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.268">the sharp pains began to break in on the strength of Atreides.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.269">As the sharp sorrow of pain descends on a woman in labour,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.270">the bitterness that the hard spirits of childbirth bring on,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.271">Hera's daughters, who hold the power of the bitter birthpangs,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.272">so the sharp pains began to break in on the strength of Atreides.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.273">He sprang back into the car, and called to his charioteer</p>
	<p id="IL.11.274">to drive him back to the hollow ships, since his heart was heavy.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.275">He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Danaans:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.276">'Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.277">you must still continue to defend our seafaring vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.11.278">from the wearying attack, since Zeus of the counsels would not</p>
	<p id="IL.11.279">allow me to do battle daylong against the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.280">He spoke, and the charioteer lashed on the bright-maned horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.281">back toward the hollow ships, and they winged their way unreluctant.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.282">The foam ran down their chests, they were powdered with dust from beneath them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.283">as they carried the stricken king away from the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.284">When Hektor was aware of Agamemnon withdrawing</p>
	<p id="IL.11.285">he called out in a great voice to Trojans and Lykians:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.286">'Trojans, Lykians and Dardanians who fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.287">be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.288">Their best man is gone, and Zeus, Kronos' son, has consented</p>
	<p id="IL.11.289">to my great glory; but steer your single-foot horses straight on</p>
	<p id="IL.11.290">at the powerful Danaans, so win you the higher glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.291">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.292">As when some huntsman drives to action his hounds with shining</p>
	<p id="IL.11.293">teeth against some savage beast, wild boar or lion,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.294">so against the Achaians Hektor the son of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.295">a man like the murderous war god, lashed on the high-hearted Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.296">And he himself with high thoughts strode out in the foremost</p>
	<p id="IL.11.297">and hurled himself on the struggle of men like a high-blown storm-cloud</p>
	<p id="IL.11.298">which swoops down from above to trouble the blue sea-water.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.299">Who then was the first, and who the last that he slaughtered,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.300">Hektor, Priam's son, now that Zeus granted him glory?</p>
	<p id="IL.11.301">Asaios first, and then Autonoös and Opites,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.302">and Dolops, Klytios' son, Opheltios and Agelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.303">and Aisymnos, and Oros, and Hipponoös stubborn in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.304">He killed these, who were lords of the Danaans, and thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.11.305">the multitude, as when the west wind strikes in the deepening</p>
	<p id="IL.11.306">whirlstorm to batter the clouds of the shining south wind,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.307">so that the bulging big waves roll hard and the blown spume</p>
	<p id="IL.11.308">scatters high before the force of the veering wind's blast.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.309">So the massed high heads of the people were struck down by Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.310">And now there might have been havoc and hopeless things done, now</p>
	<p id="IL.11.311">the running Achaians might have tumbled back into their own ships</p>
	<p id="IL.11.312">had not Odysseus cried out to Tydeus' son, Diomedes:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.313">'Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us that we have forgotten</p>
	<p id="IL.11.314">our fighting strength? Come here and stand with me, brother. There must be</p>
	<p id="IL.11.315">shame on us, if Hektor of the glancing helm captures our vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.316">Then in answer powerful Diomedes spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.317">'Yes, I will stand with you and take what I must, yet</p>
	<p id="IL.11.318">we shall not have our way for long, since Zeus the cloud-gatherer</p>
	<p id="IL.11.319">would wish to give the power to the Trojans rather than to us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.320">He spoke, and hurled down Thymbraios to the ground from his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.321">with a stroke of the spear by the left nipple. Meanwhile Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.322">killed this lord of battle's henchman, godlike Molion.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.323">They left these to lie there, since they had ended their fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.324">then went into the ranks and wrought havoc, as when two wild boars</p>
	<p id="IL.11.325">hurl themselves in their pride upon the hounds who pursue them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.326">So they whirled on the Trojans again and destroyed them. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.11.327">the Achaians gladly drew breath again after their flight from great Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.328">There they took a chariot and two men, lords in their countryside,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.329">sons both of Merops of Perkote, who beyond all men</p>
	<p id="IL.11.330">knew the art of prophecy, and tried to prevent his two sons</p>
	<p id="IL.11.331">from going into the battle where men die. Yet these would not</p>
	<p id="IL.11.332">listen, for the spirits of dark death were driving them onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.333">Tydeus' son, Diomedes of the renowned spear, stripped them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.334">of life and spirit, and took away their glorious armour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.335">while Odysseus killed Hypeirochos and Hippodamos.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.336">There the son of Kronos strained the battle even between them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.337">as he looked down from Ida. They went on killing each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.338">Now Tydeus' son stabbed with the spear Agastrophos, a chief</p>
	<p id="IL.11.339">and son of Paion, striking at the hip joint. His horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.340">were not by for his escape, but he, strongly infatuate,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.341">had a henchman holding them aside, while he, dismounted,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.342">raged on among the champions until so he lost his dear life.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.343">Hektor saw it sharply across the ranks and rose up against them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.344">with a great cry, and behind him came on the Trojan battalions.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.345">Diomedes of the great war cry shivered as he saw him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.346">and suddenly he spoke to Odysseus as he came near:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.347">'Here is this curse, Hektor the huge, wheeling down upon us.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.348">Let us stand, and hold our ground against him, and beat him off from us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.349">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.350">aiming at the head, and struck against his mark, nor missed it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.351">at the high peak of the helm, but the bronze from the bronze was driven</p>
	<p id="IL.11.352">back, nor reached his shining skin, the helmet guarded it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.353">three-ply and hollow-eyed, which Phoibos Apollo gave him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.354">But Hektor sprang far away back and merged among his own people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.355">and dropping to one knee stayed leaning on the ground with his heavy</p>
	<p id="IL.11.356">hand, and a covering of black night came over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.357">But while the son of Tydeus was following his spear's cast</p>
	<p id="IL.11.358">far throught the front fighters where it fixed in the earth, meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.11.359">Hektor got his wind again, and springing back into his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.11.360">drove back into the multitude and avoided the dark death.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.361">Then shaking his spear powerful Diomedes called to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.362">'Once again now you escaped death, dog. And yet the evil</p>
	<p id="IL.11.363">came near you, but now once more Phoibos Apollo has saved you,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.364">he to whom you must pray when you go into the thunder of spears thrown.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.365">Yet I may win you, if I encounter you ever hereafter,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.366">if beside me also there is some god who will help me.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.367">Now I must chase whoever I can overtake of the others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.368">He spoke, and set about stripping the spear-famed son of Paion.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.369">But now Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.370">pulled his bow against Tydeus' son, the shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.371">leaning against the column, work of men's hand, on the gravemound</p>
	<p id="IL.11.372">of Ilos, Dardanos' son, an elder of the folk in the old days.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.373">Now Diomedes was stripping the corselet of strong Agastrophos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.374">from about his chest, and the shining shield from his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.11.375">and the heavy helm, as the other pulled his bow at the handgrip</p>
	<p id="IL.11.376">and shot, and the arrow escaping his hand flew not vain</p>
	<p id="IL.11.377">but struck the flat of the right foot, and the shaft driven clean through</p>
	<p id="IL.11.378">stuck in the ground. Then Alexandros, laughing merrily,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.379">sprang from his hiding-place and cried out his speech of triumph:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.380">'You are hit, and my arrow flew not in vain. How I wish</p>
	<p id="IL.11.381">I had struck you in the depth of the belly and torn the life from you.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.382">So the Trojans, who shudder before you as bleating goats do</p>
	<p id="IL.11.383">before a lion, would have got their wind again after disaster.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.384">Then not at all frightened strong Diomedes answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.385">'You archer, foul fighter, lovely in your locks, eyer of young girls.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.386">If you were to make trial of me in strong combat with weapons</p>
	<p id="IL.11.387">your bow would do you no good at all, nor your close-showered arrows.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.388">Now you have scratched the flat of my foot, and even boast of this.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.389">I care no more than if a witless child or a woman</p>
	<p id="IL.11.390">had struck me; this is the blank weapon of a useless man, no fighter.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.391">But if one is struck by me only a little, that is far different,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.392">the stroke is a sharp thing and suddenly lays him lifeless,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.393">and that man's wife goes with cheeks torn in lamentation,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.394">and his children are fatherless, while he staining the soil with his red blood</p>
	<p id="IL.11.395">rots away, and there are more birds than women swarming about him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.396">He spoke, and Odysseus the spear-famed coming up from nearby</p>
	<p id="IL.11.397">stood in front; so he sat down behind him and pulled out</p>
	<p id="IL.11.398">the sharp arrow from his foot, and the hard pain came over his flesh.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.399">He sprang back into the car and called to his charioteer</p>
	<p id="IL.11.400">to drive him back to the hollow ships, since his heart was heavy.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.401">Now Odysseus the spear-famed was left alone, nor did any</p>
	<p id="IL.11.402">of the Argives stay beside him, since fear had taken all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.403">And troubled, he spoke then to his own great-hearted spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.404">'Ah me, what will become of me? It will be a great evil</p>
	<p id="IL.11.405">if I run, fearing their multitude, yet deadlier if I am caught</p>
	<p id="IL.11.406">alone; and Kronos' son drove to flight the rest of the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.407">Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?</p>
	<p id="IL.11.408">Since I know that it is the cowards who walk out of the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.409">but if one is to win honour in battle, he must by all means</p>
	<p id="IL.11.410">stand his ground strongly, whether he be struck or strike down another.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.411">While he was pondering these things in his heart and his spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.11.412">the ranks of the armoured Trojans came on against him, and penned him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.413">in their midst, but made thereby a wound in their ranks, as when</p>
	<p id="IL.11.414">closing about a wild boar the hounds and the lusty young men</p>
	<p id="IL.11.415">rush him, and he comes out of his lair in the deep of a thicket</p>
	<p id="IL.11.416">grinding to an edge the white fangs in the crook of the jawbones,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.417">and these sweep in all about him, and the vaunt of his teeth uprises</p>
	<p id="IL.11.418">as they await him, terrible though he is, without wavering;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.419">so closing on Odysseus beloved of Zeus the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.420">rushed him. First he stabbed lordly Deïopites</p>
	<p id="IL.11.421">in the shoulder, lunging from above with a stroke of the sharp spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.422">and after him he killed Thoön and Ennomos, and next</p>
	<p id="IL.11.423">stabbed Chersidamas as he sprang down from behind his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.424">in the navel with a spear's stroke underneath the massive</p>
	<p id="IL.11.425">shield, and he dropping in the dust clawed the ground with his hand. These</p>
	<p id="IL.11.426">he left lying, and stabbed with the spear the son of Hippasos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.427">Charops, full brother of Sokos, a man rich in substance. And Sokos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.428">moved in, a man like a god, to stand over his fallen brother</p>
	<p id="IL.11.429">and came and stood close by Odysseus and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.430">'Honoured Odysseus, insatiable of guile and endeavour,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.431">today you will have two sons of Hippasos to vaunt over</p>
	<p id="IL.11.432">for having killed two such men as we and stripping our armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.433">or else, stricken underneath my spear, you might lose your own life.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.434">He spoke, and stabbed Odysseus' shield in its perfect circle.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.435">All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.11.436">and crashed its way through the intricately wrought corselet,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.437">and all the skin was torn away from his ribs, yet Pallas</p>
	<p id="IL.11.438">Athene would not let the point penetrate the man's vitals.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.439">Odysseus saw that the fatal end had not yet come to him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.440">and drew back and spoke a word to Sokos: 'Ah, wretch,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.441">surely now steep destruction is advancing upon you.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.442">It is true, you have stopped my fighting against the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.443">but I declare that here and now dark death and slaughter</p>
	<p id="IL.11.444">will come upon you this day, and that beaten down under my spear</p>
	<p id="IL.11.445">you will give glory to me and your life to Hades of the horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.446">He spoke, and Sokos turning from him was striding in flight</p>
	<p id="IL.11.447">but in his back even as he was turning the spear fixed</p>
	<p id="IL.11.448">between the shoulders and was driven on through the chest beyond it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.449">He fell, thunderously, and great Odysseus boasted over him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.450">'Sokos, son of wise Hippasos the breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.451">death was too quick for you and ran you down, you could not</p>
	<p id="IL.11.452">avoid it. Wretch, since now your father and your honoured mother</p>
	<p id="IL.11.453">will not be able to close your eyes in death, but the tearing</p>
	<p id="IL.11.454">birds will get you, with their wings close-beating about you.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.455">If I die, the brilliant Achaians will bury me in honour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.456">So he spoke, and dragged the heavy spear of wise Sokos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.457">out of his flesh and out of the shield massive in the middle,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.458">and as it was torn out the blood sprang and his heart was sickened.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.459">But the great-hearted Trojans, when they saw the blood of Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.460">cried aloud through the close battle and all made a charge against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.461">He gave back a little way and called out for his companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.462">Three times he called, as much voice as a man's head could hold,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.463">and three times Menelaos the warlike heard him shouting</p>
	<p id="IL.11.464">and immediately spoke to Aias, who was near by him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.465">'Son of Telamon, seed of Zeus, Aias, lord of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.466">the war cry of patient Odysseus is ringing about me</p>
	<p id="IL.11.467">with a sound as if he had been cut off by himself, and the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.468">were handling him violently in the strong encounter. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.11.469">let us go to him through the battle. It is better to defend him against them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.470">I fear that, caught alone, he may be hurt by the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.471">brave as he is, and so a great loss may befall the Danaans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.472">He spoke, and led the way, and the other followed, a mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.11.473">like a god. They found Odysseus beloved of Zeus, and around him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.474">the Trojans crowded, as bloody scavengers in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.11.475">crowd on a horned stag who is stricken, one whom a hunter</p>
	<p id="IL.11.476">shot with an arrow from the string, and the stag has escaped him, running</p>
	<p id="IL.11.477">with his feet, while the blood stayed warm, and his knees were springing beneath him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.478">But when the pain of the flying arrow has beaten him, then</p>
	<p id="IL.11.479">the rending scavengers begin to feast on him in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.11.480">and the shaded glen. But some spirit leads that way a dangerous</p>
	<p id="IL.11.481">lion, and the scavengers run in terror, and the lion eats it;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.482">so about wise much-devising Odysseus the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.483">crowded now, valiant and numerous, but the hero</p>
	<p id="IL.11.484">with rapid play of his spear beat off the pitiless death-day.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.485">Now Aias came near him, carrying like a wall his shield,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.486">and stood forth beside him, and the Trojans fled one way and another.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.487">Then taking Odysseus by the hand warlike Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.488">led him from the battle, while his henchman drove the horses close up.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.489">But Aias leaping upon the Trojans struck down Doryklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.490">Priam's son, but a bastard, and thereafter stabbed Pandokos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.491">and so also Lysandros and Pyrasos and Pylartes.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.492">As when a swollen river hurls its water, big with rain,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.493">down the mountains to the flat land following rain from the sky god,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.494">and sweeps down with it numbers of dry oaks and of pine trees</p>
	<p id="IL.11.495">numbers, until it hurls its huge driftwood into the salt sea;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.496">so now glittering Aias cumbered the plain as he chased them,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.497">slaughtering men and horses alike, nor yet had Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.11.498">heard, since he was fighting at the left of the entire battle</p>
	<p id="IL.11.499">by the banks of Skamandros river, where more than elsewhere</p>
	<p id="IL.11.500">the high heads of men were dropping, and the tireless clamour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.501">rising about tall Nestor and Idomeneus the warlike.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.502">Now Hektor was encountering these and doing grim work</p>
	<p id="IL.11.503">with spear and horsemanship, ruining the battalions of young men.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.504">Yet even so the Achaians would not have given from his path</p>
	<p id="IL.11.505">had not Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.506">stayed from his bravery the shepherd of the people, Machaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.507">hitting him with a three-barbed arrow in the right shoulder.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.508">And the Achaians whose wind was fury were frightened for him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.509">that the enemy might catch him in the backturn of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.510">At once Idomeneus called out to brilliant Nestor:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.511">'Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.512">quick, get up on your chariot, let Machaon beside you</p>
	<p id="IL.11.513">mount, and steer your single-foot horses to the ships in all speed.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.514">A healer is a man worth many men in his knowledge</p>
	<p id="IL.11.515">of cutting out arrows and putting kindly medicines on wounds.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.516">He spoke, and the Gerenian horseman Nestor obeyed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.517">Immediately he mounted the chariot, and Machaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.518">son of the great healer Asklepios, mounted beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.519">He lashed on the horses, and they winged their way unreluctant</p>
	<p id="IL.11.520">back toward the hollow ships, since this was the way they desired.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.521">Now Kebriones, who saw how the Trojans were being driven,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.522">and who stood beside Hektor in the chariot, spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.523">'Hektor, you and I encounter the Danaans at the utmost</p>
	<p id="IL.11.524">edge of the sorrowful battle, but meanwhile the rest of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.525">are driven pell-mell upon each other, the men and their horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.526">The Telamonian Aias drives them; I know him surely</p>
	<p id="IL.11.527">for he carries the broad shield on his shoulders. So, let us also</p>
	<p id="IL.11.528">steer our horses and chariot that way, since there the horsemen</p>
	<p id="IL.11.529">and the foot-ranks more than elsewhere hurling the wicked war-hate</p>
	<p id="IL.11.530">against each other, are destroying, and the ceaseless clamour has risen.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.531">So he spoke, and lashed forward the bright-maned horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.532">with the singing whip, and they at the feel of the stroke lightly</p>
	<p id="IL.11.533">carried the running chariot among Achaians and Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.534">trampling down dead men and shields, and the axle under</p>
	<p id="IL.11.535">the chariot was all splashed with blood and the rails which encircled</p>
	<p id="IL.11.536">the chariot, struck by flying drops from the feet of the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.537">from the running rims of the wheels. So Hektor was straining to plunge in</p>
	<p id="IL.11.538">the turmoil of men, and charge them and break them. He hurled the confusion</p>
	<p id="IL.11.539">of disaster upon the Danaans, and stayed from the spear's stroke</p>
	<p id="IL.11.540">little, but ranged about among the ranks of the rest of the fighters</p>
	<p id="IL.11.541">with his spear and his sword and with huge stones flung,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.542">yet kept clear still of the attack of Telamonian Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.543">For Zeus was ever wrathful at him, that he would fight a better man</p>
	<p id="IL.11.544">And Zeus father who sits on high drove fear upon Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.545">He stood stunned, and swung the sevenfold ox-hide shield behind him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.546">and drew back, throwing his eyes round the crowd of men, like a wild beast,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.547">turning on his way, shifting knee past knee only a little;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.548">as when the men who live in the wild and their dogs have driven</p>
	<p id="IL.11.549">a tawny lion away from the mid-fenced ground of their oxen,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.550">and will not let him tear out the fat of the oxen, watching</p>
	<p id="IL.11.551">nightlong against him, and he in his hunger for meat closes in</p>
	<p id="IL.11.552">but can get nothing of what he wants, for the raining javelins</p>
	<p id="IL.11.553">thrown from the daring hands of the men beat ever against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.554">and the flaming torches, and these he balks at for all of his fury</p>
	<p id="IL.11.555">and with the daylight goes away, disappointed of desire;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.556">so Aias, disappointed at heart, drew back from the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.11.557">much unwilling, but feared for the ships of the Achaians. As when</p>
	<p id="IL.11.558">a donkey, stubborn and hard to move, goes into a cornfield</p>
	<p id="IL.11.559">in despite of boys, and many sticks have been broken upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.560">but he gets in and goes on eating the deep grain, and the children</p>
	<p id="IL.11.561">beat him with sticks, but their strength is infantile; yet at last</p>
	<p id="IL.11.562">by hard work they drive him out when he is glutted with eating;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.563">so the high-hearted Trojans and companions in arms gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.11.564">from far places kept after great Aias, the son of Telamon,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.565">stabbing always with their spears at the centre of the great shield.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.566">And now Aias would remember again his furious valour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.567">and turn upon them, and beat back the battalions of Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.568">breakers of horses, and then again would turn and run from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.569">He blocked them all from making their way on to the fast ships</p>
	<p id="IL.11.570">and himself stood and fought on in the space between the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.571">and Trojans, and of the spears thrown by the daring hands of the fighters</p>
	<p id="IL.11.572">some that were driven forward stuck fast in the great shield, others</p>
	<p id="IL.11.573">and many in the mid space before they had got to his white skin</p>
	<p id="IL.11.574">stood fast in the ground, though they had been straining to reach his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.575">Now as Eurypylos the glorious son of Euaimon</p>
	<p id="IL.11.576">saw how Aias was being overpowered by the dense spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.577">he came and stood beside him and made a cast with his bright spear</p>
	<p id="IL.11.578">and struck Apisaon, son of Phausias, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.579">in the liver under the midriff, and at once took the strength from his knees.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.580">Eurypylos springing forward stripped the armour from his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.11.581">but godlike Alexandros watched him as he was stripping</p>
	<p id="IL.11.582">the armour of Apisaon, and at once drew his bow, and shot</p>
	<p id="IL.11.583">at Eurypylos, and hit him in the right thigh with the arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.584">and the reed shaft was broken off, and his thigh was heavy with pain.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.585">To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.586">He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Danaans:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.587">'Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.588">turn again and stand and beat off the pitiless death-day</p>
	<p id="IL.11.589">from Aias, who is being overpowered with spears thrown; and I think</p>
	<p id="IL.11.590">he cannot escape out of this sorrowful battle. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.11.591">stand fast and face them around great Aias, the son of Telamon.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.592">So spoke wounded Eurypylos, and the others about him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.593">stood in their numbers and sloped their shields over his shoulders, holding</p>
	<p id="IL.11.594">the spears away, and Aias came back to join them. He turned</p>
	<p id="IL.11.595">and stood, when he had got back to the swarm of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.596">So they fought on in the likeness of blazing fire. And meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.11.597">the horses of Neleus sweating carried Nestor away from</p>
	<p id="IL.11.598">the fighting, and carried also the shepherd of the people, Machaon.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.599">Now swift-footed brilliant Achilleus saw him and watched him,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.600">for he was standing on the stern of his huge-hollowed vessel</p>
	<p id="IL.11.601">looking out over the sheer war work and the sorrowful onrush.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.602">At once he spoke to his own companion in arms, Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.603">calling from the ship, and he heard it from inside the shelter, and came out</p>
	<p id="IL.11.604">like the war god, and this was the beginning of his evil.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.605">The strong son of Menoitios spoke first, and addressed him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.606">'What do you wish with me, Achilleus? Why do you call me?'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.607">Then in answer again spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.608">'Son of Menoitios, you who delight my heart, o great one,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.609">now I think the Achaians will come to my knees and stay there</p>
	<p id="IL.11.610">in supplication, for a need past endurance has come to them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.611">But go now, Patroklos beloved of Zeus, to Nestor</p>
	<p id="IL.11.612">and ask him who is this wounded man he brings in from the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.613">Indeed, seeing him from behind I thought he was like Machaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.614">Asklepios' son, in all ways, but I got no sight of the man's face</p>
	<p id="IL.11.615">since the horses were tearing forward and swept on by me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.616">So he spoke, and Patroklos obeyed his beloved companion</p>
	<p id="IL.11.617">and went on the run along the shelters and ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.618">Now when the others came to the shelter of the son of Neleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.619">they themselves dismounted to the prospering earth, and the henchman</p>
	<p id="IL.11.620">Eurymedon unharnessed the horses of the old man</p>
	<p id="IL.11.621">from the chariot. The men wiped off the sweat on their tunics</p>
	<p id="IL.11.622">and stood to the wind beside the beach of the sea, and thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.11.623">went inside the shelter and took their places on settles.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.624">And lovely-haired Hekamede made them a potion, she whom</p>
	<p id="IL.11.625">the old man won from Tenedos, when Achilleus stormed it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.626">She was the daughter of great-hearted Arsinoös. The Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.627">chose her out for Nestor, because he was best of them all in counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.628">First she pushed up the table in front of them, a lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.11.629">table, polished and with feet of cobalt, and on it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.630">she laid a bronze basket, with onion to go with the drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.631">and pale honey, and beside it bread, blessed pride of the barley,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.632">and beside it a beautifully wrought cup which the old man brought with him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.633">from home. It was set with golden nails, the eared handles upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.634">were four, and on either side there were fashioned two doves</p>
	<p id="IL.11.635">of gold, feeding, and there were double bases beneath it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.636">Another man with great effort could lift it full from the table,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.637">but Nestor, aged as he was, lifted it without strain.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.638">In this the woman like the immortals mixed them a potion</p>
	<p id="IL.11.639">with Pramneian wine, and grated goat's-milk cheese into it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.640">with a bronze grater, and scattered with her hand white barley into it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.641">When she had got the potion ready, she told them to drink it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.642">and both when they had drunk it were rid of their thirst's parching</p>
	<p id="IL.11.643">and began to take pleasure in conversation, talking with each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.644">and Patroklos came and stood, a godlike man, in the doorway.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.645">Seeing him the old man started up from his shining</p>
	<p id="IL.11.646">chair, and took him by the hand, led him in and told him to sit down,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.647">but Patroklos from the other side declined, and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.648">'No chair, aged sir beloved of Zeus. You will not persuade me.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.649">Honoured, and quick to blame, is the man who sent me to find out</p>
	<p id="IL.11.650">who was this wounded man you were bringing. Now I myself</p>
	<p id="IL.11.651">know, and I see it is Machaon, the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.652">Now I go back as messenger to Achilleus, to tell him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.653">You know yourself, aged sir beloved of Zeus, how he is;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.654">a dangerous man; he might even be angry with one who is guiltless.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.655">Then in turn the Gerenian horseman Nestor answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.656">'Now why is Achilleus being so sorry for the sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.657">who have been wounded with spears thrown, he who knows nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.11.658">of the sorrow that has risen along the host, since the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.11.659">are lying up among the ships with arrow or spear wounds?</p>
	<p id="IL.11.660">The son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes, was hit by an arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.661">and Odysseus has a pike wound, and Agamemnon the spear-famed,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.662">and Eurypylos has been wounded in the thigh with an arrow. And even now</p>
	<p id="IL.11.663">I have brought this other one, Machaon, out of the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.11.664">hit by an arrow from the bowstring. Meanwhile Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.665">brave as he is cares nothing for the Danaans nor pities them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.666">Is he going to wait then till the running ships by the water</p>
	<p id="IL.11.667">are burned with consuming fire for all the Argives can do, till</p>
	<p id="IL.11.668">we ourselves are killed one after another? Since there is not</p>
	<p id="IL.11.669">any longer in my gnarled limbs the strength that there once was.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.670">If only I were young now, and the strength still steady within me,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.671">as that time when a quarrel was made between us and the Eleians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.672">over a driving of cattle, when I myself killed Itymoneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.673">the brave son of Hypeirochos who made his home in Elis.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.674">I was driving cattle in reprisal, and he, as he was defending</p>
	<p id="IL.11.675">his oxen, was struck among the foremost by a spear thrown from my hand</p>
	<p id="IL.11.676">and fell, and his people who live in the wild fled in terror about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.677">And we got and drove off together much spoil from this pastureland:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.678">fifty herds of oxen, as many sheepflocks, as many</p>
	<p id="IL.11.679">droves of pigs, and again as many wide-ranging goatflocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.680">and a hundred and fifty brown horses, mares all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.681">and many with foals following underneath. And all there</p>
	<p id="IL.11.682">we drove inside the keep of Neleian Pylos, making</p>
	<p id="IL.11.683">our way nightwise to the town. And Neleus was glad in his heart</p>
	<p id="IL.11.684">that so much had come my way, who was young to go to the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.685">And next day as dawn showed the heralds lifted their clear cry</p>
	<p id="IL.11.686">for all to come who had anything owed them in shining Elis.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.687">And the men who were chiefs among the Pylians assembling</p>
	<p id="IL.11.688">divided the spoil. There were many to whom the Epeians owed something</p>
	<p id="IL.11.689">since we in Pylos were few and we had been having the worst of it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.690">For Herakles had come in his strength against us and beaten us</p>
	<p id="IL.11.691">in the years before, and all the bravest among us had been killed.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.692">For we who were sons of lordly Neleus had been twelve, and now</p>
	<p id="IL.11.693">I alone was left of these, and all the others had perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.694">and grown haughty over this the bronze-armoured Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.695">despised and outraged us, and devised wicked actions against us.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.696">Now the old man took for himself a herd of cattle and a big flock</p>
	<p id="IL.11.697">of sheep, choosing out three hundred of them along with the shepherds;</p>
	<p id="IL.11.698">for indeed a great debt was owing to him in shining Elis.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.699">It was four horses, race-competitors with their own chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.700">who were on their way to a race and were to run for a tripod,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.701">but Augeias the lord of men took these, and kept them</p>
	<p id="IL.11.702">and sent away their driver who was vexed for the sake of the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.703">Now aged Neleus, angry over things said and things done,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.704">took a vast amount for himself, and gave the rest to the people</p>
	<p id="IL.11.705">to divide among them, so none might go away without a just share.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.706">So we administered all this spoil, and all through the city</p>
	<p id="IL.11.707">wrought sacrifices to the gods; and on the third day the Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.708">came all against us, numbers of men and single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.709">in full haste, and among them were armoured the two Moliones,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.710">boys still, not yet altogether skilled in furious fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.711">There is a city, Thryoessa, a headlong hill town</p>
	<p id="IL.11.712">far away by the Alpheios at the bottom of sandy Pylos.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.713">They had thrown their encampment about that place, furious to smash it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.714">But when they had swept the entire plain, Athene came running</p>
	<p id="IL.11.715">to us, a messenger from Olympos by night, and warned us</p>
	<p id="IL.11.716">to arm. It was no hesitant host she assembled in Pylos</p>
	<p id="IL.11.717">but people straining hard toward the battle. Now Neleus would not</p>
	<p id="IL.11.718">let me be armed among them, and had hidden away my horses</p>
	<p id="IL.11.719">because he thought I was not yet skilled in the work of warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.720">Even so I was pre-eminent among our own horsemen</p>
	<p id="IL.11.721">though I went on foot; since thus Athene guided the battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.722">There is a river, Minyeïos, which empties its water</p>
	<p id="IL.11.723">in the sea beside Arene. There we waited for the divine Dawn,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.724">we horsemen among the Pylians, and the hordes of the streaming foot-soldiers,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.725">and from there having armed in all speed and formed in our armour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.726">we came by broad daylight to the sacred stream of Alpheios.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.727">There we wrought fine sacrifices to Zeus in his great strength</p>
	<p id="IL.11.728">and sacrificed a bull to Alpheios, a bull to Poseidon,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.729">but to Athene of the grey eyes a cow from the herds. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.11.730">we took our dinner along the host in divided watches</p>
	<p id="IL.11.731">and went to sleep, each man in his own armour, by the current</p>
	<p id="IL.11.732">of the river, and meanwhile the high-hearted Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.733">had taken their places around the city, furious to smash it.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.734">But sooner than this there was shown forth a great work of the war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.735">for when the sun in his shining lifted above the earth, then</p>
	<p id="IL.11.736">we joined our battle together, with prayers to Zeus and Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.737">Now when the battle came on between Pylians and Epeians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.738">I was first to kill a man, and I won his single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.739">It was Moulios the spearman who was son-in-law to Augeias</p>
	<p id="IL.11.740">and had as wife his eldest daughter, fair-haired Agamede</p>
	<p id="IL.11.741">who knew of all the medicines that are grown in the broad earth.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.742">As he came on I threw and hit him with the bronze-headed spear</p>
	<p id="IL.11.743">and he dropped in the dust, whereupon I springing into his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.11.744">took my place among the champions, as the high-hearted Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.745">fled one way and another in terror when they saw the man fall</p>
	<p id="IL.11.746">who was leader of their horsemen and the best of them all in fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.747">Then I charged upon them like a black whirlwind, and overtook</p>
	<p id="IL.11.748">fifty chariots, and for each of the chariots two men</p>
	<p id="IL.11.749">caught the dirt in their teeth beaten down under my spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.750">And now I would have killed the young Moliones, scions</p>
	<p id="IL.11.751">of Aktor, had not their father who shakes the earth in his wide strength</p>
	<p id="IL.11.752">caught them out of the battle, shrouding them in a thick mist.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.753">Then Zeus gave huge power into the hands of the Pylians,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.754">for we chased them on over the hollow plain, killing</p>
	<p id="IL.11.755">the men themselves, and picking up their magnificent armour</p>
	<p id="IL.11.756">until we brought our horses to Bouprasion of the wheatfields</p>
	<p id="IL.11.757">and the Olenian rock, where there is a hill called the hill</p>
	<p id="IL.11.758">of Alesios. There at last Athene turned back our people.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.759">There I killed my last man and left him. There the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.760">steered back from Bouprasion to Pylos their fast-running horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.761">and all glorified Zeus among the gods, but among men Nestor.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.762">That was I, among men, if it ever happened. But Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.763">will enjoy his own valour in loneliness, though I think</p>
	<p id="IL.11.764">he will weep much, too late, when his people are perished from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.765">Dear child, surely this was what Menoitios told you</p>
	<p id="IL.11.766">that day when he sent you out from Phthia to Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.767">We two, brilliant Odysseus and I, were inside with you</p>
	<p id="IL.11.768">and listened carefully to everything, all that he told you.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.769">For we had come to the strong-established house of Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.770">assembling fighting men all through generous Achaia. We came</p>
	<p id="IL.11.771">there, and found the hero Menoitios inside, and you,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.772">Achilleus beside you, and Peleus the aged horseman was burning</p>
	<p id="IL.11.773">the fat thigh pieces of an ox to Zeus who delights in the thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.11.774">in the garth of the courtyard. He was holding a golden beaker</p>
	<p id="IL.11.775">and pouring the bright wine over the burning dedications. You two</p>
	<p id="IL.11.776">were over the meat of the ox attending to it, and we came</p>
	<p id="IL.11.777">and stood in the forecourt, and Achilleus sprang up wondering</p>
	<p id="IL.11.778">and took us by the hand and led us in, and told us to sit down,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.779">and set hospitality properly before us, as is the stranger's</p>
	<p id="IL.11.780">right. Now when we had taken our pleasure of eating and drinking</p>
	<p id="IL.11.781">I began to talk, and invited you both to come with us,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.782">and you were altogether willing, and your fathers spoke to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.783">And Peleus the aged was telling his own son, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.784">to be always best in battle and pre-eminent beyond all others,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.785">but for you, Menoitios, Aktor's son, had this to say to you:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.786">"My child, by right of blood Achilleus is higher than you are,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.787">but you are the elder. Yet in strength he is far the greater.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.788">You must speak solid words to him, and give him good counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.789">and point his way. If he listens to you it will be for his own good."</p>
	<p id="IL.11.790">This is what the old man told you, you have forgotten. Yet even</p>
	<p id="IL.11.791">now you might speak to wise Achilleus, he might be persuaded.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.792">Who knows if, with God helping, you might trouble his spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.11.793">by entreaty, since the persuasion of a friend is a strong thing.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.794">But if he is drawing back from some prophecy known in his own heart</p>
	<p id="IL.11.795">and by Zeus' will his honoured mother has told him of something,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.796">let him send you out, at least, and the rest of the Myrmidon people</p>
	<p id="IL.11.797">follow you, and you may be a light given to the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.798">And let him give you his splendid armour to wear to the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.799">if perhaps the Trojans might think you are he, and give way</p>
	<p id="IL.11.800">from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind</p>
	<p id="IL.11.801">again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.802">You, unwearied, might with a mere cry pile men wearied</p>
	<p id="IL.11.803">back upon their city, and away from the ships and the shelters.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.804">So he spoke, and stirred the feeling in the breast of Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.805">and he went on the run along the ships to the son of Aiakos,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.806">Achilleus. But as Patroklos came in his running to the ships</p>
	<p id="IL.11.807">of great Odysseus, where the Achaians had their assembly and dealt out</p>
	<p id="IL.11.808">rights, and where were established their altars to the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.809">there Eurypylos, who had been wounded in the thigh with an arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.810">met him, the illustrious son of Euaimon, limping</p>
	<p id="IL.11.811">away from the battle, and the watery sweat was running</p>
	<p id="IL.11.812">down his shoulders and face, and from the sore wound dark blood</p>
	<p id="IL.11.813">continued to drip, and yet the will stayed steady within him.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.814">And the strong son of Menoitios looked on him in pity</p>
	<p id="IL.11.815">and was sorrowful over him, and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.816">'Poor wretches, you leaders and men of counsel among the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.817">was it your fate then, far from your friends and the land of your fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.818">to glut with your shining fat the running dogs here in Troy land?</p>
	<p id="IL.11.819">But tell me this, my lord Eurypylos grown under God's hand:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.820">will the Achaians somehow be able to hold huge Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.11.821">or must they now perish beaten down under his spear?'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.822">Then Eurypylos who was wounded answered him in turn:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.823">'No longer, illustrious Patroklos, can the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.11.824">defend themselves, but they will be piled back into their black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.825">For all of these who were before the bravest in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.11.826">are lying up among the ships with arrow or spear wounds</p>
	<p id="IL.11.827">under the hands of the Trojans whose strength is forever on the uprise.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.828">But help save me now at least, leading me away to my black ship,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.829">and cut the arrow out of my thigh, wash the dark blood running</p>
	<p id="IL.11.830">out of it with warm water, and put kind medicines on it,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.831">good ones, which they say you have been told of by Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.832">since Cheiron, most righteous of the Centaurs, told him about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.833">As for Machaon and Podaleirios, who are healers,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.834">I think Machaon has got a wound, and is in the shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.11.835">lying there, and himself is in need of a blameless healer,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.836">while the other in the plain is standing the bitter attack of the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.837">Then in turn the strong son of Menoitios spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.11.838">'But how shall this be, my lord Eurypylos, how shall we do it?</p>
	<p id="IL.11.839">I am on my way carrying a message to wise Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.11.840">given me by Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians' watcher.</p>
	<p id="IL.11.841">But even so I will not leave you in your affliction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.11.842">He spoke, and holding the shepherd of the host under the arms led him</p>
	<p id="IL.11.843">to his shelter, and a henchman seeing them spread out some ox-hides,</p>
	<p id="IL.11.844">and Patroklos laid him there and with a knife cut the sharp tearing</p>
	<p id="IL.11.845">arrow out of his thigh, and washed the black blood running from it</p>
	<p id="IL.11.846">with warm water, and, pounding it up in his hands, laid on</p>
	<p id="IL.11.847">a bitter root to make pain disappear, one which stayed</p>
	<p id="IL.11.848">all kinds of pain. And the wound dried, and the flow of blood stopped.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.1">So within the shelter the warlike son of Menoitios</p>
	<p id="IL.12.2">tended stricken Eurypylos, and meanwhile the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.12.3">and Trojans fought on in massed battle, nor was the Danaans'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.4">ditch going to hold them back nor the wide wall above it</p>
	<p id="IL.12.5">they had built for the sake of their ships, and driven a deep ditch</p>
	<p id="IL.12.6">about it, and had not given to the gods grand sacrifices</p>
	<p id="IL.12.7">so that it might guard their running ships and their masses</p>
	<p id="IL.12.8">of spoil within it. It had been built in despite of the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.12.9">gods, and therefore it was not to stand firm for a long time.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.10">So long as Hektor was still alive, and Achilleus was angry,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.11">so long as the citadel of lord Priam was a city untaken,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.12">for this time the great wall of the Achaians stood firm. But afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.12.13">when all the bravest among the Trojans had died in the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.14">and many of the Argives had been beaten down, and some left,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.15">when in the tenth year the city of Priam was taken</p>
	<p id="IL.12.16">and the Argives gone in their ships to the beloved land of their fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.17">then at last Poseidon and Apollo took counsel</p>
	<p id="IL.12.18">to wreck the wall, letting loose the strength of rivers upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.19">all the rivers that run to the sea from the mountains of Ida,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.20">Rhesos and Heptaporos, Karesos and Rhodios,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.21">Grenikos and Aisepos, and immortal Skamandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.22">and Simoeis, where much ox-hide armour and helmets were tumbled</p>
	<p id="IL.12.23">in the river mud, and many of the race of the half-god mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.24">Phoibos Apollo turned the mouths of these waters together</p>
	<p id="IL.12.25">and nine days long threw the flood against the wall, and Zeus rained</p>
	<p id="IL.12.26">incessantly, to break the wall faster and wash it seaward.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.27">And the shaker of the earth himself holding in his hands the trident</p>
	<p id="IL.12.28">guided them, and hurled into the waves all the bastions' strengthening</p>
	<p id="IL.12.29">of logs and stones the toiling Achaians had set in position</p>
	<p id="IL.12.30">and made all smooth again by the hard-running passage of Helle</p>
	<p id="IL.12.31">and once again piled the great beach under sand, having wrecked</p>
	<p id="IL.12.32">the wall, and turned the rivers again to make their way down</p>
	<p id="IL.12.33">the same channel where before they had run the bright stream of their water.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.34">Thus, afterwards, Poseidon and Apollo were minded</p>
	<p id="IL.12.35">to put things in place, but at this time battle and clamour were blazing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.36">about the strong-founded wall and the bastion timbers were thundering</p>
	<p id="IL.12.37">as they were struck, as the Argives broken under Zeus' lashing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.38">were crowded back on their hollow ships, and struggled to get clear</p>
	<p id="IL.12.39">in dread of Hektor, the strong one who drove men to thoughts of panic.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.40">But Hektor, as he had before, fought on like a whirlwind.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.41">As when among a pack of hounds and huntsmen assembled</p>
	<p id="IL.12.42">a wild boar or lion turns at bay in the strength of his fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.43">and the men, closing themselves into a wall about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.44">stand up to face him, and cast at him with the volleying spears thrown</p>
	<p id="IL.12.45">from their hands, and in spite of this the proud heart feels not</p>
	<p id="IL.12.46">terror, nor turns to run, and it is his own courage that kills him;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.47">and again and again he turns on them trying to break the massed men</p>
	<p id="IL.12.48">and wherever he charges the masses of men break away in front of him;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.49">such was Hektor as he went through the battle and rallied his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.12.50">and drove them on to cross over the ditch, but now the fast-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.12.51">horses balked at the edge of the lip, and dared not cross, whinnying</p>
	<p id="IL.12.52">loud, since the ditch in its great width frightened them from it,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.53">being not easy for them to overleap, nor to walk through,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.54">since along the whole length the jut of the overhangs stood</p>
	<p id="IL.12.55">on both sides, and the surface of the floor was thickset with pointed</p>
	<p id="IL.12.56">palisades, which the sons of the Achaians had paled there</p>
	<p id="IL.12.57">dense and huge, so as to hold off the rage of attackers.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.58">And a horse straining at the strong-wheeled chariot might not easily</p>
	<p id="IL.12.59">enter there, but the dismounted were strong in their effort.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.60">And now Poulydamas stood beside bold Hektor, and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.61">'Hektor, and other lords of the Trojans and companions in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.62">we are senseless trying to drive our fast-footed horses over</p>
	<p id="IL.12.63">this ditch. It is hard indeed to cross, and sharp stakes are planted</p>
	<p id="IL.12.64">inside it, and across from these the wall of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.65">There there is no way to get down, no way again to do battle</p>
	<p id="IL.12.66">from horses, for the passage is narrow and I think they must be hurt there.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.67">For now if Zeus who thunders on high in evil intention</p>
	<p id="IL.12.68">toward these is destroying them utterly, sending aid to the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.69">this is the way I would wish it, may it happen immediately</p>
	<p id="IL.12.70">that the Achaians be destroyed here forgotten and far from</p>
	<p id="IL.12.71">Argos; but if they turn again and a backrush comes on us</p>
	<p id="IL.12.72">out of the ships, and we are driven against the deep ditch,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.73">then I think no longer could one man to carry a message</p>
	<p id="IL.12.74">get clear to the city, once the Achaians have turned back upon us.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.75">Come then, do as I say, let us all be persuaded; let us</p>
	<p id="IL.12.76">tell our henchmen to check our horses here by the ditch, then</p>
	<p id="IL.12.77">let ourselves, all of us dismounted and armed in our war gear,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.78">follow Hektor in mass formation. As for the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.79">they will not hold, if the bonds of death are fastened upon them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.80">So spoke Poulydamas, and this counsel of safety pleased Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.81">And at once in all his armour he leapt to the ground from his chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.82">and the rest of the Trojans assembled, not mounted behind their horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.83">but all sprang to the ground, when they saw brilliant Hektor had done it.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.84">Then each man gave orders to his own charioteer</p>
	<p id="IL.12.85">to check the horses in good order at the edge of the ditch,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.86">and the fighters formed apart into groups, then closing together</p>
	<p id="IL.12.87">into five well-ordered battalions followed their leaders.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.88">They who went with Hektor and Poulydamas the blameless,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.89">these were most numerous, and bravest, and beyond others furious</p>
	<p id="IL.12.90">to smash the wall and fight their way among the hollow ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.91">and Kebriones went with them as third man, while by the chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.12.92">Hektor had left another man, not so good as Kebriones.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.93">Paris led the next group with Alkathoös and Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.94">and Helenos, with godlike Deïphobos, led the third group,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.95">sons both of Priam, and Asios was with them as third man,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.96">Asios, son of Hyrtakos, whom his tall shining horses</p>
	<p id="IL.12.97">had carried over from Arisbe and beside the river Selleëis.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.98">The leader of the fourth group was the strong son of Anchises,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.99">Aineias, and with him were the two sons of Antenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.100">Archelochos and Akamas, both skilled in all fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.101">Sarpedon led the far-renowned companions in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.102">and had chosen to go with him Glaukos and warlike Asteropaios</p>
	<p id="IL.12.103">since these seemed to him to be marked out as the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.12.104">of the rest, after himself, but among all he was pre-eminent.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.105">Now when these had closed their wrought ox-hide shields together</p>
	<p id="IL.12.106">they charged straight for the Danaans, eagerly, with no thought longer</p>
	<p id="IL.12.107">of being held, but rather to hurl themselves on the black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.108">Then the rest of the Trojans and renowned companions in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.12.109">were willing to follow the order of blameless Poulydamas. Only</p>
	<p id="IL.12.110">Asios, Hyrtakos' son, lord of men, was unwilling</p>
	<p id="IL.12.111">to leave his horses there and a charioteer to attend them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.112">but kept them with him, and so drove on at the fast-running vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.113">poor fool, who by the ships in the pride of his horses and chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.12.114">was not destined to evade the evil spirits of destruction</p>
	<p id="IL.12.115">nor ever to make his way back again to windy Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.116">Before this the dark-named destiny had shrouded about him</p>
	<p id="IL.12.117">through the spear of Idomeneus, proud son of Deukalion.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.118">For he sent his horses to the left of the ships, where the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.119">were streaming back from the level ground with horses and chariots,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.120">and this way he drove his chariot and horses, and found there</p>
	<p id="IL.12.121">the leaves not yet pushed home in the gates, nor the long door-bar,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.122">but men were holding them wide apart, on the chance of rescuing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.123">some one of their companions running for the ships from the battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.124">Of a purpose he steered his horses straight there, and his men followed</p>
	<p id="IL.12.125">screaming aloud, since they thought the Achaians no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.12.126">would hold, but that they would be driven back on their dark ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.127">Fools! since in the gates they found two men of the bravest,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.128">high-hearted sons of the spear-fighting Lapithai, one</p>
	<p id="IL.12.129">the son of Peirithoös, powerful Polypoites,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.130">and one Leonteus, a man like the murderous god of battles.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.131">Now these two, who had taken their place in front of the high gates,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.132">stood there like two oaks who rear their crests in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.12.133">and through day upon day stand up to the wind and the rainbeat</p>
	<p id="IL.12.134">since their great roots reach far and are gripped in the ground. So</p>
	<p id="IL.12.135">these two, in the confidence of their strength and their hands' work,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.136">stood up to tall Asios advancing upon them, nor gave way.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.137">But these, holding up high the tanned leather of their shields, moved</p>
	<p id="IL.12.138">straight in on the strong-built wall with enormous clamour</p>
	<p id="IL.12.139">around Asios their lord and Iamenos and Orestes,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.140">and Asios' son Adamas, and Oinomaos and Thoön.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.141">In this time the Lapithai still inside the wall were striving</p>
	<p id="IL.12.142">to stir up the strong-greaved Achaians to defend the vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.143">but among the Danaans, when they saw the Trojans sweeping</p>
	<p id="IL.12.144">on against the wall, a clamour arose, and they gave way;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.145">and the two bursting through the gates fought on in front of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.146">They were in the likeness of two wild boars who in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.12.147">await a rabble of men and dogs advancing upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.148">and as they go tearing slantwise and rip the timber about them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.149">to pieces at the stock, the grinding scream of their teeth sounds</p>
	<p id="IL.12.150">high, until some man hits them with his throw and takes the life from them;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.151">such was the grinding scream from the bright bronze covering their chests</p>
	<p id="IL.12.152">struck hard on by spears, for they fought a very strong battle</p>
	<p id="IL.12.153">in the confidence of their own strength and the people above them.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.154">These flung about them with great stones torn from the strong-founded</p>
	<p id="IL.12.155">bastions, as they fought in defence of themselves, and the shelters,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.156">and the fast-running vessels, so that the flung stones dropped to the ground</p>
	<p id="IL.12.157">like snowflakes which the winds' blast whirling the shadowy clouds</p>
	<p id="IL.12.158">drifts in their abundance along the prospering earth. So</p>
	<p id="IL.12.159">the missiles flung from the hands of Achaians, and Trojans also,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.160">went showering, and the helms and shields massive in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.12.161">crashed hollow underneath the impact of rocks like millstones.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.162">And now Asios, Hyrtakos' son, groaned aloud and beat on</p>
	<p id="IL.12.163">both thighs with his hands, and spoke aloud in his agony:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.164">'Zeus father, now even you are made utterly a lover</p>
	<p id="IL.12.165">of deception. For I never thought the fighting Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.166">would be able to hold our strength and our hands invincible.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.167">But they, as wasps quick-bending in the middle, or as bees</p>
	<p id="IL.12.168">will make their homes at the side of the rocky way, and will not</p>
	<p id="IL.12.169">abandon the hollow house they have made, but stand up to</p>
	<p id="IL.12.170">men who come to destroy them, and fight for the sake of their children,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.171">so these, though they are only two, are unwilling to give back</p>
	<p id="IL.12.172">from the gates, until they have killed their men, or are taken.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.173">He spoke, but by such talk did not persuade the heart of Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.12.174">whose desire it was to extend the glory to Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.175">And now at the various gates various men fought each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.176">It were too much toil for me, as if I were a god, to tell all this,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.177">for all about the stone wall the inhuman strength of the fire</p>
	<p id="IL.12.178">was rising, and the Argives fought unhappily, yet they must fight</p>
	<p id="IL.12.179">on, to defend their ships. And all the gods who were helpers</p>
	<p id="IL.12.180">of the Danaans in the fighting were dejected in spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.181">But the Lapithai fought on and closed in the hateful fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.182">and there the son of Peirithoös, powerful Polypoites,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.183">struck Damasos with the spear through the bronze-sided helmet,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.184">and the brazen helmet could not hold, but the bronze spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.12.185">driven on through smashed the bone apart, and the inward</p>
	<p id="IL.12.186">brain was all spattered forth. So he beat him down in his fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.187">Then he went on to kill Pylon and Ormenos. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.12.188">Leonteus, the scion of Ares, struck down Antimachos'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.189">son, Hippomachos, with a spear cast into the war belt</p>
	<p id="IL.12.190">and afterwards drawing his sharp sword out of the scabbard</p>
	<p id="IL.12.191">made a rush through the crowding men, and struck from close up</p>
	<p id="IL.12.192">Antiphates first, so that he crashed on his back to the ground, then</p>
	<p id="IL.12.193">beat down along the prospering earth Menon and Orestes</p>
	<p id="IL.12.194">and Iamenos, all beaten down in rapid succession.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.195">Now as these were stripping their men of the shining armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.196">the fighting men following with Poulydamas and Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.197">who were most numerous, and bravest, and beyond others furious</p>
	<p id="IL.12.198">to smash the wall, and set fire to the vessels, these still</p>
	<p id="IL.12.199">were divided in doubt as they stood there at the ditch's edge.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.200">As they were urgent to cross a bird sign had appeared to them,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.201">an eagle, flying high and holding to the left of the people</p>
	<p id="IL.12.202">and carrying in its talons a gigantic snake, blood-coloured,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.203">alive still and breathing, it had not forgotten its warcraft</p>
	<p id="IL.12.204">yet, for writhing back it struck the eagle that held it</p>
	<p id="IL.12.205">by chest and neck, so that the eagle let it drop groundward</p>
	<p id="IL.12.206">in pain of the bite, and dashed it down in the midst of the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.12.207">and itself, screaming high, winged away down the wind's blast.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.208">And the Trojans shivered with fear as they looked on the lithe snake</p>
	<p id="IL.12.209">lying in their midst, a portent of Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.210">And now Poulydamas stood beside bold Hektor and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.211">'Hektor, somehow in assembly you move ever against me</p>
	<p id="IL.12.212">though I speak excellently, since indeed there is no good reason</p>
	<p id="IL.12.213">for you, in your skill, to argue wrong, neither in the councils</p>
	<p id="IL.12.214">nor in the fighting, and ever to be upholding your own cause.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.215">Now once more I will speak out the way it seems best to me.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.216">Let us not go on and fight the Danaans by their ships. I think</p>
	<p id="IL.12.217">it will end as the portent was accomplished, if the bird sign</p>
	<p id="IL.12.218">that came to the Trojans as we were trying to cross was a true one,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.219">an eagle, flying high and holding to the left of the people</p>
	<p id="IL.12.220">and carrying in its talons a gigantic snake, blood-coloured,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.221">alive, but let it drop suddenly before winning his own home,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.222">and could not finish carrying it back to give to his children.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.223">So we, even though in our great strength we break in the gates</p>
	<p id="IL.12.224">and the wall of the Achaians, and the Achaians give way before us,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.225">we shall not take the same ways back from the ships in good order;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.226">since we shall leave many Trojans behind us, whom the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.227">will cut down with the bronze as they fight for themselves by their vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.228">So an interpreter of the gods would answer, one who knew</p>
	<p id="IL.12.229">in his mind the truth of portents, and whom the people believed in.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.230">Looking darkly at him tall Hektor of the shining helm answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.231">'Poulydamas, these things that you argue please me no longer.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.232">Your mind knows how to contrive a saying better than this one.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.233">But if in all seriousness this is your true argument, then</p>
	<p id="IL.12.234">it is the very gods who ruined the brain within you,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.235">you who are telling me to forget the counsels of thunderous</p>
	<p id="IL.12.236">Zeus, in which he himself nodded his head to me and assented.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.237">But you: you tell me to put my trust in birds, who spread</p>
	<p id="IL.12.238">wide their wings. I care nothing for these, I think nothing of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.239">nor whether they go by on our right against dawn and sunrise</p>
	<p id="IL.12.240">or go by to the left against the glooming mist and the darkness.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.241">No, let us put our trust in the counsel of great Zeus, he who</p>
	<p id="IL.12.242">is lord over all mortal men and all the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.243">One bird sign is best: to fight in defence of our country.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.244">Why are you so afraid of war and hostility? Even</p>
	<p id="IL.12.245">though all the rest of us were to be cut down around you</p>
	<p id="IL.12.246">among the Argive ships, you would run no danger of dying</p>
	<p id="IL.12.247">since your heart is not enduring in battle nor a fighter's.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.248">But if you shrink away from the murderous work, or turn back</p>
	<p id="IL.12.249">some other man from the fighting, beguiling him with your arguments,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.250">at once beaten down under my spear you will lose your own life.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.251">He spoke, and led the way, and the rest of them came on after him</p>
	<p id="IL.12.252">with unearthly clamour, and over them Zeus who delights in the thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.12.253">drove down from among the hills of Ida the blast of a windstorm</p>
	<p id="IL.12.254">which swept the dust straight against the ships. He was mazing the minds</p>
	<p id="IL.12.255">of the Achaians, and giving glory to the Trojans and Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.256">and they in the confidence of the portents shown, and their own strength,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.257">worked to break down the great wall of the Achaians. They tore</p>
	<p id="IL.12.258">at the projections on the outworks, and broke down the battlements</p>
	<p id="IL.12.259">and shook with levers the jut of the buttresses the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.260">had stuck in the earth on the outer face to shore their defences.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.261">They tore at these, in hope of breaking down the Achaians'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.262">wall, but now the Danaans did not give way in front of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.263">but they, fencing the battlements with the hides of oxen,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.264">hurled from the wall at the enemy who came on beneath it.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.265">The two Aiantes, walking up and down the length of the ramparts,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.266">urged the men on, stirring up the warcraft of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.267">and stung them along, using kind words to one, to another</p>
	<p id="IL.12.268">hard ones, whenever they saw a man hang back from the fighting:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.269">'Dear friends, you who are pre-eminent among the Argives, you who</p>
	<p id="IL.12.270">are of middle estate, you who are of low account, since</p>
	<p id="IL.12.271">all of us are not alike in battle, this is work for all now,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.272">and you yourselves can see it. Now let no man let himself</p>
	<p id="IL.12.273">be turned back upon the ships for the sound of their blustering</p>
	<p id="IL.12.274">but keep forever forward calling out courage to each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.275">So may Olympian Zeus who grips the thunderbolt grant us</p>
	<p id="IL.12.276">a way to the city, when we beat off the attack of our enemies.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.277">Such was their far cry, and they stirred the Achaians' war strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.278">And they, as storms of snow descend to the ground incessant</p>
	<p id="IL.12.279">on a winter day, when Zeus of the counsels, showing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.280">before men what shafts he possesses, brmgs on a snowstorm</p>
	<p id="IL.12.281">and stills the winds asleep in the solid drift, enshrouding</p>
	<p id="IL.12.282">the peaks that tower among the mountains and the shoulders out-jutting,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.283">and the low lands with their grasses, and the prospering work of men's hands,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.284">and the drift falls along the grey sea, the harbours and beaches,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.285">and the surf that breaks against it is stilled, and all things elsewhere</p>
	<p id="IL.12.286">it shrouds from above, with the burden of Zeus' rain heavy upon it;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.287">so numerous and incessant were the stones volleyed from both sides,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.288">some thrown on Trojans, others flung against the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.289">by Trojans, so the whole length of the wall thundered beneath them.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.290">And not even then might the Trojans and glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.12.291">have broken in the gates of the rampart, and the long door-bar,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.292">had not Zeus of the counsels driven his own son, Sarpedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.293">upon the Argives, like a lion among horn-curved cattle.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.294">Presently he held before him the perfect circle of his shield,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.295">a lovely thing of beaten bronze, which the bronze-smith hammered</p>
	<p id="IL.12.296">out for him, and on the inward side had stitched ox-hides</p>
	<p id="IL.12.297">in close folds with golden staples clean round the circle.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.298">Holding this shield in front of him, and shaking two spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.299">he went onward like some hill-kept lion, who for a long time</p>
	<p id="IL.12.300">has gone lacking meat, and the proud heart is urgent upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.12.301">to get inside of a close steading and go for the sheepflocks.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.302">And even though he finds herdsmen in that place, who are watching</p>
	<p id="IL.12.303">about their sheepflocks, armed with spears, and with dogs, even so</p>
	<p id="IL.12.304">he has no thought of being driven from the steading without some attack made,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.305">and either makes his spring and seizes a sheep, or else</p>
	<p id="IL.12.306">himself is hit in the first attack by a spear from a swift hand</p>
	<p id="IL.12.307">thrown. So now his spirit drove on godlike Sarpedon</p>
	<p id="IL.12.308">to make a rush at the wall and break apart the battlements.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.309">And now he spoke in address to Glaukos, son of Hippolochos:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.310">'Glaukos, why is it you and I are honoured before others</p>
	<p id="IL.12.311">with pride of place, the choice meats and the filled wine cups</p>
	<p id="IL.12.312">in Lykia, and all men look on us as if we were immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.313">and we are appointed a great piece of land by the banks of Xanthos,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.314">good land, orchard and vineyard, and ploughland for the planting of wheat?</p>
	<p id="IL.12.315">Therefore it is our duty in the forefront of the Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.316">to take our stand, and bear our part of the blazing of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.317">so that a man of the close-armoured Lykians may say of us:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.318">"Indeed, these are no ignoble men who are lords of Lykia,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.319">these kings of ours, who feed upon the fat sheep appointed</p>
	<p id="IL.12.320">and drink the exquisite sweet wine, since indeed there is strength</p>
	<p id="IL.12.321">of valour in them, since they fight in the forefront of the Lykians."</p>
	<p id="IL.12.322">Man, supposing you and I, escaping this battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.323">would be able to live on forever, ageless, immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.324">so neither would I myself go on fighting in the foremost</p>
	<p id="IL.12.325">nor would I urge you into the fighting where men win glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.326">But now, seeing that the spirits of death stand close about us</p>
	<p id="IL.12.327">in their thousands, no man can turn aside nor escape them,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.328">let us go on and win glory for ourselves, or yield it to others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.329">He spoke, nor did Glaukos disobey him nor turn aside from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.330">They, leading the great horde of the Lykians, advanced straight onward,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.331">and the son of Peteos, Menestheus, shivered as he saw them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.332">since they came against his bastion and carried disaster upon it.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.333">He scanned the rampart of the Achaians in the hope of seeing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.334">some great chief who could beat back the bane from his company,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.335">and saw the two Aiantes, insatiate of battle, standing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.336">on the wall, and Teukros even now coming up from the shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.337">and close by, but he was not able to cry out and make them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.338">hear, so great was the clamour about him as the shouts hit skyward,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.339">as shields were battered with missiles, and the helmets crested with horse-hair,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.340">and the gates, which all had been slammed shut, and the Trojans standing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.341">against them were trying to break them down and force their way in.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.342">At once he sent Thoötes off as a runner to Aias:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.343">'Go on the run, brilliant Thoötes, and call Aias here,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.344">or better, both Aiantes, since that would be far the best thing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.345">that could happen, since here headlong destruction is building against us.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.346">Such is the weight of the Lykian lords upon us, who even</p>
	<p id="IL.12.347">before now have shown as deadly men in the strong encounters.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.348">But if in their place also hard work and fury have arisen,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.349">at least let powerful Telamonian Aias come by himself,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.350">and let Teukros follow with him, with his craft in the bow's use.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.351">He spoke, nor did the herald disobey when he heard him,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.352">but went on the run along the wall of the bronze-armoured Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.353">and came and stood by the two Aiantes, and spoke to them straight out:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.354">'Aiantes, leaders of the bronze-armoured Argives: Menestheus,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.355">beloved son of Peteos engendered of Zeus, desires you</p>
	<p id="IL.12.356">to go where he is and meet the danger, if only for a little;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.357">both of you for choice, since that would be far the best thing</p>
	<p id="IL.12.358">that could happen, since there headlong destruction is building against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.359">Such is the weight of the Lykian lords upon him, who even</p>
	<p id="IL.12.360">before now have shown as deadly men in the strong encounters.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.361">But if in this place also hard fighting and fury have arisen,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.362">at least let powerful Telamonian Aias come by himself</p>
	<p id="IL.12.363">and let Teukros follow with him, with his craft in the bow's use.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.364">He spoke, and huge Telamonian Aias did not disobey him,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.365">but at once called out in winged words to Aias, the son of Oïleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.366">'Aias, now you two, yourself and strong Lykomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.367">must stand your ground and urge on the Danaans to fight strongly.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.368">I am going over there to meet the attack, and afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.12.369">I will come back soon, when I have beaten them back from the others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.370">So speading Telamonian Aias went away, and with him</p>
	<p id="IL.12.371">went Teukros, his brother by the same father, and following them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.372">was Pandion, who carried the curved bow for Teukros.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.373">They kept inside the wall as they went, till they came to the bastion</p>
	<p id="IL.12.374">of high-hearted Menestheus, and found men who were hard pressed there,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.375">for the strong lords and men of counsel among the Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.376">came on against the battlements like a darkening stormwind,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.377">and they charged forward to fight with these, and the clamour rose high.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.378">First to kill his man was Telamonian Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.379">It was Sarpedon's companion in arms, high-hearted Epikles,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.380">whom he struck with a great jagged stone, that lay at the inside</p>
	<p id="IL.12.381">of the wall, huge, on top of the battlements. A man could not easily</p>
	<p id="IL.12.382">hold it, not even if he were very strong, in both hands,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.383">of men such as men are now, but he heaving it high threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.384">and smashed in the four-sheeted helm, and pounded to pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.12.385">the bones of the head inside it, so that Epikles dropped</p>
	<p id="IL.12.386">like a diver from the high bastion, and the life left his bones.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.387">And Teukros with an arrow struck the strong son of Hippolochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.388">Glaukos, as he was swarming aloft the wall's high bastion,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.389">where he saw the arm was bare of defence, and stayed his warcraft;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.390">he sprang down from the wall, secretly, for fear some Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.12.391">might see that he had been hit and vaunt with high words over him.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.392">Sarpedon, as soon as he was aware that Glaukos had gone back,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.393">was downcast, nevertheless he did not forget his warcraft</p>
	<p id="IL.12.394">but striking with his spear at Alkmaon, the son of Thestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.395">stabbed him, then wrenched the spear out, and he following the spear fell</p>
	<p id="IL.12.396">on his face, and the armour elaborate with bronze clashed about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.397">And Sarpedon, grabbing in both ponderous hands the battlements,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.398">pulled, and the whole thing came away in his hands, and the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.12.399">was stripped defenceless above. He had opened a pathway for many.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.400">Aias and Teukros aimed at him together, and Teukros</p>
	<p id="IL.12.401">hit him with an arrow in the shining belt that encircled</p>
	<p id="IL.12.402">his chest to hold the man-covering shield, but Zeus brushed the death spirits</p>
	<p id="IL.12.403">from his son, and would not let him be killed there beside the ships' sterns;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.404">and Aias plunging upon him stabbed at the shield, but the spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.12.405">did not pass clean through. Still, he pounded him back in his fury</p>
	<p id="IL.12.406">so that he gave back a little space from the battlement, and yet not</p>
	<p id="IL.12.407">utterly gave way, since his heart was still hopeful of winning glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.408">He whirled about and called aloud to the godlike Lykians:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.409">'Lykians, why do you thus let go of your furious valour?</p>
	<p id="IL.12.410">It is a hard thing for me, strong as I am, to break down</p>
	<p id="IL.12.411">the wall, single-handed, and open a path to the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.412">Come on with me then. This work is better if many do it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.413">So he spoke, and they, awed at the reproach of their leader,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.414">put on the pressure of more weight around their lord of the counsels.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.415">And on the other side the Argives stiffened their battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.12.416">inside the wall, and a huge fight developed between the two sides.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.417">For neither could the powerful Lykians break in the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.12.418">of the Danaans, and so open a path through to the vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.419">nor had the Danaan spearmen strength to push back the Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.12.420">from the rampart, once they had won to a place close under it;</p>
	<p id="IL.12.421">but as two men with measuring ropes in their hands fight bitterly</p>
	<p id="IL.12.422">about a boundary line at the meeting place of two cornfields,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.423">and the two of them fight in the strait place over the rights of division,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.424">so the battlements held these armies apart, and across them</p>
	<p id="IL.12.425">they hewed at each other, and at the ox-hide shields strong-circled</p>
	<p id="IL.12.426">guarding men's chests, and at the fluttering straps of the guard-skins.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.427">Many were torn in their white flesh by the bronze without pity</p>
	<p id="IL.12.428">wherever one of the fighters turning aside laid bare</p>
	<p id="IL.12.429">his back, and many were struck with the spear carried clean through the shield.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.430">Everywhere the battlements and the bastions were awash</p>
	<p id="IL.12.431">with men's blood shed from both sides, Achaian and Trojan.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.432">But even so they could not drive panic among the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.433">but held evenly as the scales which a careful widow</p>
	<p id="IL.12.434">holds, taking it by the balance beam, and weighs her wool evenly</p>
	<p id="IL.12.435">at either end, working to win a pitiful wage for her children:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.436">so the battles fought by both sides were pulled fast and even</p>
	<p id="IL.12.437">until that time when Zeus gave the greater glory to Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.438">Priam's son, who was first to break into the wall of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.439">For he lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.12.440">'Rise up, Trojans, breakers of horses, and wreck the ramparts</p>
	<p id="IL.12.441">of the Argives, and let loose the inhuman fire on their vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.12.442">So he spoke, driving them on, and they all gave ear to him</p>
	<p id="IL.12.443">and steered against the wall in a pack, and at once gripping</p>
	<p id="IL.12.444">still their edged spears caught and swarmed up the wall's projections.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.445">Meanwhile Hektor snatched up a stone that stood before the gates</p>
	<p id="IL.12.446">and carried it along; it was blunt-massed at the base, but the upper</p>
	<p id="IL.12.447">end was sharp; two men, the best in all a community,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.448">could not easily hoist it up from the ground to a wagon,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.449">of men such as men are now, but he alone lifted and shook it</p>
	<p id="IL.12.450">as the son of devious-devising Kronos made it light for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.451">As when a shepherd easily carries the fleece of a wether,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.452">picking it up with one hand, and little is the burden weighting him,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.453">so Hektor lifting the stone carried it straight for the door leaves</p>
	<p id="IL.12.454">which filled the gateway ponderously close-fitted together.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.455">These were high and twofold, and double door-bars on the inside</p>
	<p id="IL.12.456">overlapping each other closed it, and a single pin-bolt secured them.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.457">He came and stood very close and taking a strong wide stance threw</p>
	<p id="IL.12.458">at the middle, leaning into the throw, that the cast might not lack</p>
	<p id="IL.12.459">force, and smashed the hinges at either side, and the stone crashed</p>
	<p id="IL.12.460">ponderously in, and the gates groaned deep, and the door-bars</p>
	<p id="IL.12.461">could not hold, but the leaves were smashed to a wreckage of splinters</p>
	<p id="IL.12.462">under the stone's impact. Then glorious Hektor burst in</p>
	<p id="IL.12.463">with dark face like sudden night, but he shone with the ghastly</p>
	<p id="IL.12.464">glitter of bronze that girded his skin, and carried two spears</p>
	<p id="IL.12.465">in his hands. No one could have stood up against him, and stopped him,</p>
	<p id="IL.12.466">except the gods, when he burst in the gates; and his eyes flashed fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.467">Whirling, he called out across the battle to the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.12.468">to climb over the wall, and they obeyed his urgency.</p>
	<p id="IL.12.469">Immediately some swarmed over the wall, while others swept in</p>
	<p id="IL.12.470">through the wrought gateways, and the Danaans scattered in terror</p>
	<p id="IL.12.471">among their hollow ships, and clamour incessant rose up.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.1">WHEN Zeus had driven against the ships the Trojans and Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.2">he left them beside these to endure the hard work and sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.13.3">of fighting without respite, and himself turned his eyes shining</p>
	<p id="IL.13.4">far away, looking out over the land of the Thracian riders</p>
	<p id="IL.13.5">and the Mysians who fight at close quarters, and the proud Hippomolgoi,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.6">drinkers of milk, and the Abioi, most righteous of all men.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.7">He did not at all now turn his shining eyes upon Troy land</p>
	<p id="IL.13.8">for he had no idea in mind that any one of the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.13.9">would come down to stand by either Danaans or Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.10">Neither did the powerful shaker of the earth keep blind watch;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.11">for he sat and admired the fighting and the run of the battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.12">aloft on top of the highest summit of timbered Samos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.13">the Thracian place; and from there all Ida appeared before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.14">and the city of Priam was plain to see, and the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.15">There he came up out of the water, and sat, and pitied the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.16">who were beaten by the Trojans, and blamed Zeus for it in bitterness.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.17">So presently he came down from the craggy mountain, striding</p>
	<p id="IL.13.18">on rapid feet, and the tall mountains trembled and the timber</p>
	<p id="IL.13.19">under the immortal feet of Poseidon's progress.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.20">He took three long strides forward, and in the fourth came to his goal,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.21">Aigai, where his glorious house was built in the waters'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.22">depth, glittering with gold, imperishable forever.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.23">Going there he harnessed under his chariot his bronze-shod horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.24">flying-footed, with long manes streaming of gold; and he put on</p>
	<p id="IL.13.25">clothing of gold about his own body, and took up the golden</p>
	<p id="IL.13.26">lash, carefully compacted, and climbed up into his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.13.27">and drove it across the waves. And about him the sea beasts came up</p>
	<p id="IL.13.28">from their deep places and played in his path, and acknowledged their master,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.29">and the sea stood apart before him, rejoicing. The horses winged on</p>
	<p id="IL.13.30">delicately, and the bronze axle beneath was not wetted.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.31">The fast-running horses carried him to the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.32">There is a cave, broad and deep down in the gloom of the water,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.33">lying midway between Tenedos and Imbros of the high cliffs.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.34">There Poseidon the shaker of the earth reined in his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.35">and slipped them from the yoke, and threw fodder immortal before them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.36">so they could eat, and threw around their feet golden hobbles</p>
	<p id="IL.13.37">not to be broken or slipped from, so they would wait there steadfast</p>
	<p id="IL.13.38">for their lord gone. And Poseidon went to the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.39">But the Trojans, gathered into a pack, like flame, like a stormcloud,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.40">came on after Hektor the son of Priam, raging relentless,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.41">roaring and crying as one, and their hopes ran high of capturing</p>
	<p id="IL.13.42">the ships of the Achaians, and killing the best men beside them,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.43">all of them. But Poseidon who circles the earth and shakes it</p>
	<p id="IL.13.44">rose up out of the deep water to stir on the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.45">likening himself in form and weariless voice to Kalchas.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.46">First he spoke to the Aiantes, who were burning for battle already:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.47">'Aiantes, you two, remembering the spirit of warcraft</p>
	<p id="IL.13.48">and not that of shivering panic, must save the Achaian people.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.49">Elsewhere in truth I do not fear the Trojans' invincible</p>
	<p id="IL.13.50">hands, though in full force they have swarmed over our great wall;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.51">since the strong-greaved Achaians will be able to hold the rest of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.52">But I fear most terribly disaster to us in the one place</p>
	<p id="IL.13.53">where that berserk flamelike leads them against us, Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.54">who claims he must be son of Zeus of the high strength. May this</p>
	<p id="IL.13.55">be the message some one of the gods gives your minds to carry,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.56">that you stand fast strongly yourselves, urge the rest to stand also.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.57">Thus, hard though he sweeps on, you might stay him beside the fast-running</p>
	<p id="IL.13.58">ships, even though the very Olympian wakes him to battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.59">Poseidon who circles the earth and shakes it spoke, and striking</p>
	<p id="IL.13.60">both of them with his staff filled them with powerful valour,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.61">and he made their limbs light, and their feet, and their hands above them,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.62">and burst into winged flight himself, like a hawk with quick wings</p>
	<p id="IL.13.63">who from the huge height of an impassable rock lifting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.64">leans to flight to pursue some other bird over the wide land;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.65">so Poseidon shaker of the earth broke away from the Aiantes.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.66">And of the two swift Aias son of Oïleus was first</p>
	<p id="IL.13.67">to know him, and spoke therewith to Aias the son of Telamon;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.68">'Aias, since some one of the gods, whose hold is Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.69">has likened himself to the seer, and told us to fight by our vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.70">this is not Kalchas, the bird interpreter of the gods, for I knew</p>
	<p id="IL.13.71">easily as he went away the form of his feet, the legs' form</p>
	<p id="IL.13.72">from behind him. Gods, though gods, are conspicuous. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.13.73">as for me, the spirit inside my inward breast drives me</p>
	<p id="IL.13.74">all the harder to carry on the war and the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.75">and my feet underneath me are eager and my hands above them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.76">Aias the son of Telamon spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.77">'So for me also now the invincible hands on my spearshaft</p>
	<p id="IL.13.78">are furious, my strength is rising, and both feet beneath me</p>
	<p id="IL.13.79">are sweeping me onward, so that I long even for single combat</p>
	<p id="IL.13.80">with Hektor, Priam's son, the forever avid of battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.81">Now as these two were saying such things to each other, joyful</p>
	<p id="IL.13.82">in the delight of battle the god had put into their spirits,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.83">meanwhile the earth-encircler stirred up the Achaians behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.84">who were cooling the heat of the inward heart back beside their vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.85">for their very limbs were broken with weariness of hard work, and also</p>
	<p id="IL.13.86">discouragement of the heart came over them, as they watched</p>
	<p id="IL.13.87">the Trojans, and how in a mass they had overswarmed the great wall.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.88">As they saw them the tears dripped from their eyes; they did not</p>
	<p id="IL.13.89">think they could win clear of the evil, but the earth-shaker</p>
	<p id="IL.13.90">lightly turning their battalions to strength drove them onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.91">He came first in encouragement to Teukros and Leïtos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.92">with the fighting Peneleos, and Deïpyros and Thoas,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.93">to Meriones and Antilochos, both urgent for battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.94">Calling out to these in winged words he rallied them onward:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.95">'Shame, you Argives, young fighting men, since I for my part</p>
	<p id="IL.13.96">have confidence that by fighting you can save our ships from destruction;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.97">but if you yourselves are to go slack from the sorrowful fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.98">now is seen your day to be beaten down by the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.99">Oh for shame! Here is a great strange thing I see with my own eyes,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.100">a terrible thing, and one that I thought never could happen,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.101">that the Trojans could come against our ships, they who in time past</p>
	<p id="IL.13.102">were like fugitive deer before us, who in the forests</p>
	<p id="IL.13.103">are spoil for scavengers and wolves and leopards, who scatter</p>
	<p id="IL.13.104">in absolute cowardice, there is no war spirit within them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.105">So before now the Trojans were unwilling to stand up</p>
	<p id="IL.13.106">against the strength and hands of the Achaians, even for a little,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.107">but now far from their city they fight by the hollow vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.13.108">through the weakness of our leader, and the hanging back of our people</p>
	<p id="IL.13.109">who have made their quarrel with him, and will not stand in defence</p>
	<p id="IL.13.110">of the fast-running ships. Instead of this they are killed against them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.111">Yet even though it be utterly true that the son of Atreus</p>
	<p id="IL.13.112">the hero wide-powerful Agamemnon is guilty</p>
	<p id="IL.13.113">because he did dishonour to Peleus' son, the swift-footed,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.114">still there is no way for us now to hang back from the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.115">No, sooner let us heal it, for the hearts of great men can be healed.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.116">But you can no longer in honour give way from your fighting valour</p>
	<p id="IL.13.117">being all the best men along the host. Even I, for my part,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.118">would not quarrel with any man who hung back from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.119">because he was a weak thing, but with you my heart must be angry.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.120">O friends, soon you will bring to pass some still greater evil</p>
	<p id="IL.13.121">with this hanging back. Let every one of you plant in his heart's depth</p>
	<p id="IL.13.122">discipline and shamefastness. A big battle rises against you.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.123">For Hektor of the great war cry is fighting beside our vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.13.124">in his power, and has broken our gates and the long door-bar.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.125">So urging them on the earth-encircler stirred up the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.126">and their battalions formed in strength about the two Aiantes,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.127">battalions the war god could not find fault with, coming among them,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.128">nor Athene lady of storming armies, since there the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.13.129">formed apart and stood against the Trojans and brilliant Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.13.130">locking spear by spear, shield against shield at the base, so buckler</p>
	<p id="IL.13.131">leaned on buckler, helmet on helmet, man against man,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.132">and the horse-hair crests along the horns of their shining helmets</p>
	<p id="IL.13.133">touched as they bent their heads, so dense were they formed on each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.134">and the spears shaken from their daring hands made a jagged battle line.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.135">Their thoughts were driving straight ahead in the fury of fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.136">The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.137">raging straight forward, like a great rolling stone from a rock face</p>
	<p id="IL.13.138">that a river swollen with winter rain has wrenched from its socket</p>
	<p id="IL.13.139">and with immense washing broken the hold of the unwilling rock face;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.140">the springing boulder flies on, and the forest thunders beneath it;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.141">and the stone runs unwavering on a strong course, till it reaches</p>
	<p id="IL.13.142">the flat land, then rolls no longer for all its onrush;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.143">so Hektor for a while threatened lightly to break through</p>
	<p id="IL.13.144">the shelters and ships of the Achaians and reach the water</p>
	<p id="IL.13.145">cutting his way. But when he collided with the dense battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.13.146">he was stopped, hard, beaten in on himself. The sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.147">against him stabbing at him with swords and leaf-headed spears</p>
	<p id="IL.13.148">thrust him away from them so that he gave ground backward, staggering.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.149">He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.150">'Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.151">stand with me. The Achaians will not hold me back for a long time</p>
	<p id="IL.13.152">for all they are building themselves into a bastion against me.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.153">No, I think they will give back under my spear, if truly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.154">I am driven by the greatest of gods, the thunderous lord of Hera.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.155">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.156">Among them Deïphobos in high purpose had come striding,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.157">Priam's son, who held the perfect circle of his shield before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.158">moving lightly on his feet as he walked in the shield's protection.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.159">Meriones aimed at him with the shining spear, and threw it</p>
	<p id="IL.13.160">nor missed his mark, but struck the shield on its perfect circle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.161">of bull's hide, but the spear did not get through, but sooner</p>
	<p id="IL.13.162">the long shaft was broken behind the head. Deïphobos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.163">held the bull's-hide shield away from him, his heart frightened</p>
	<p id="IL.13.164">by the spear of wise Meriones, but that hero drew back</p>
	<p id="IL.13.165">into the host of his own companions, deeply angered</p>
	<p id="IL.13.166">for two things, the broken spear and the loss of his battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.167">and went away back to the shelters and ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.168">to bring back a long spear that was left behind in his shelter.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.169">But the rest fought on with clamour incessant rising about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.170">Teukros, son of Telamon, was the first to kill his man, Imbrios</p>
	<p id="IL.13.171">the spearfighter, son of Mentor of the many horses, one who</p>
	<p id="IL.13.172">before the coming of the sons of the Achaians lived in Pedaios</p>
	<p id="IL.13.173">and had married a bastard daughter of Priam, Medesikaste.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.174">But when the oarswept ships of the Danaans came, he went back</p>
	<p id="IL.13.175">to Ilion, and was a great man among the Trojans, and lived</p>
	<p id="IL.13.176">at Priam's side, who honoured him as he did his own children.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.177">Now the son of Telamon with the long spear stabbed him under</p>
	<p id="IL.13.178">the ear, and wrenched the spear out again, and he dropped like an ash tree</p>
	<p id="IL.13.179">which, on the crest of a mountain glittering far about, cut down</p>
	<p id="IL.13.180">with the bronze axe scatters on the ground its delicate leafage;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.181">so he dropped, and the armour elaborate with bronze clashed</p>
	<p id="IL.13.182">about him, and Teukros ran up, eager to strip the armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.183">As he came on Hektor threw at him with the shining javelin,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.184">but Teukros with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.185">by a little, and Hektor struck Amphimachos, son of Aktorian</p>
	<p id="IL.13.186">Kteatos, with a spear in his chest as he swept into battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.187">He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.188">Then Hektor charged in to tear the helm of great-hearted Amphimachos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.189">from his head where it fitted close on the brows, but Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.13.190">thrust with the shining spear at Hektor as he came onward;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.191">he could not manage to reach the skin, since this was all shrouded</p>
	<p id="IL.13.192">in the ghastly bronze, but drove at the shield's mass in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.193">and beat him back in great strength so that Hektor gave ground backward</p>
	<p id="IL.13.194">from both corpses. These the Achaians dragged out of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.195">Then Stichios and brilliant Menestheus, lords of the Athenians,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.196">carried Amphimachos back among the Achaian people.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.197">But the two Aiantes in the fury of their fierce war strength,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.198">as two lions catch up a goat from the guard of rip-fanged</p>
	<p id="IL.13.199">hounds, and carry it into the density of the underbrush,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.200">holding it high from the ground in the crook of their jaws, so the lordly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.201">two Aiantes lifted Imbrios high and stripped him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.202">of his armour, and the son of Oïleus, in anger</p>
	<p id="IL.13.203">for Amphimachos, hewed away his head from the soft neck</p>
	<p id="IL.13.204">and threw it spinning like a ball through the throng of fighters</p>
	<p id="IL.13.205">until it came to rest in the dust at the feet of Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.206">Then Poseidon was angered about the heart at his grandson's</p>
	<p id="IL.13.207">slaying in the bitter hostility, so the god went forth</p>
	<p id="IL.13.208">on his way among the shelters and ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.209">and stirred the Danaans, and worked disaster against the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.210">Idomeneus the spear-famed encountered him, on his way</p>
	<p id="IL.13.211">from a companion, who had just before come back from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.212">wounded in the hollow behind the knee by the sharp bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.213">This man his companions carried away. Idomeneus had given</p>
	<p id="IL.13.214">the healers instructions and gone on to his shelter, still burning</p>
	<p id="IL.13.215">to face the battle, and now the strong earth-shaker spoke to him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.216">Poseidon likened his voice to Thoas, son of Andraimon,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.217">lord of the Aitolians over all Pleuron, and headlong</p>
	<p id="IL.13.218">Kalydon, who was honoured in his countryside as a god is:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.219">'Idomeneus, lord of the Kretans' councils, where are those threats you gave</p>
	<p id="IL.13.220">now, that the sons of the Achaians uttered against the Trojans?'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.221">Then Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.222">'Thoas, no man is responsible for this, so far as</p>
	<p id="IL.13.223">my thought goes, since all of us understand how to wage war.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.224">It is not that heartless fear holds anyone, that a man yielding</p>
	<p id="IL.13.225">to dread emerges out of the evil fighting, but rather</p>
	<p id="IL.13.226">this way must be pleasurable to Kronos' son in his great strength,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.227">that the Achaians must die here forgotten, and far from Argos.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.228">Since you, Thoas, have been before this a man stubborn in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.229">and stirred up another whenever you saw one hang back, so now</p>
	<p id="IL.13.230">also do not give up, and urge on each man as you find him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.231">Then in answer spoke the shaker of the earth, Poseidon:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.232">'Idomeneus, may that man who this day wilfully hangs back</p>
	<p id="IL.13.233">from the fighting never win home again out of Troy land,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.234">but stay here and be made dogs' delight for their feasting. Come then,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.235">take up your armour and go with me. We must speed this action</p>
	<p id="IL.13.236">together, since we, being two, might bring some advantage.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.237">The warcraft even of sad fighters combined turns courage,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.238">and you and I would have skill to fight even against good men.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.239">So he spoke and strode on, a god, through the mortals' struggle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.240">Idomeneus, when he came back to his strong-built shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.241">drew his splendid armour over his body, and caught up two spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.242">and went on his way, as a thunderbolt, which the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.243">catching up in his hand shakes from the shining edge of Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.244">flashes as a portent to men and the bright glints shine from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.245">Such was the glitter of bronze that girt his chest in his running.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.246">Close to his shelter there encountered him his strong henchman,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.247">Meriones, who was on his way to pick up a bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.248">and bring it back. Idomeneus in his strength spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.249">'Meriones, son of Molos, swift-footed, dearest beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.13.250">companion, why have you come back and left the battle and fighting?</p>
	<p id="IL.13.251">Have you been hit somewhere? Does pain of a spear's head afflict you?</p>
	<p id="IL.13.252">Have you come back with someone's message for me? For my part</p>
	<p id="IL.13.253">my desire is to fight, not sit away in the shelters.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.254">Meriones, a thoughtful man, spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.255">'Idomeneus, lord of the counsels of the bronze-armoured Kretans,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.256">I am on my way to bring back a spear, if you have any</p>
	<p id="IL.13.257">left in your shelter. I broke just now the one I was carrying</p>
	<p id="IL.13.258">with a throw made against the shield of haughty Deïphobos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.259">Then Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.260">'You will find one spear, and twenty spears, if you want them,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.261">standing against the shining inward wall in my shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.262">Trojan spears I win from men that I kill, for my way</p>
	<p id="IL.13.263">is not to fight my battles standing far away from my enemies.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.264">Thereby I have spears there, and shields massive in the middle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.265">and helms and corselets are there in all the pride of their shining.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.266">Meriones, a thoughtful man, spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.267">'For me also, beside my shelter and beside my black ship,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.268">there are many spoils of the Trojans, but not near for me to get them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.269">For I tell you, neither am I one who has forgotten his war strength</p>
	<p id="IL.13.270">but among the foremost, along the fighting where men win glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.271">I take my stand, whenever the quarrel of battle arises.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.272">Let my fighting be forgotten by some other bronze-armoured</p>
	<p id="IL.13.273">Achaian. You are the very one I think must know of it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.274">Then Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.275">'I know your valour and what you are. Why need you speak of it?</p>
	<p id="IL.13.276">If now beside the ships all the best of us were to assemble</p>
	<p id="IL.13.277">for a hidden position, and there man's courage is best decided,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.278">where the man who is a coward and the brave man show themselves clearly:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.279">the skin of the coward changes colour one way and another,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.280">and the heart inside him has no control to make him sit steady,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.281">but he shifts his weight from one foot to another, then settles firmly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.282">on both feet, and the heart inside his chest pounds violent</p>
	<p id="IL.13.283">as he thinks of the death spirits, and his teeth chatter together:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.284">but the brave man's skin will not change colour, nor is he too much</p>
	<p id="IL.13.285">frightened, once he has taken his place in the hidden position,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.286">but his prayer is to close as soon as may be in bitter division:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.287">and there no man could make light of your battle strength or your hand's work.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.288">Even were you to be wounded in your work with spearcast or spearstroke,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.289">the weapon would not strike behind your neck, nor in your back,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.290">but would be driven straight against the chest or the belly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.291">as you made your way onward through the meeting of champions.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.292">But come, let us no longer stand here talking of these things</p>
	<p id="IL.13.293">like children, for fear some man may arrogantly scold us.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.294">Go to my shelter and choose for yourself a heavy spear.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.295">So he spoke; Meriones, a match for the rapid war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.296">went into the shelter rapidly, and took up a bronze spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.297">and with his mind deeply set on battle followed Idomeneus.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.298">As manslaughtering Ares is when he strides into battle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.299">and Terror goes on beside him, his beloved son, the powerful</p>
	<p id="IL.13.300">and dauntless, who frightens even the patient-hearted warrior:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.301">these two come out of Thrace to encounter in arms the Ephyroi</p>
	<p id="IL.13.302">or the great-hearted Phlegyes, but the two will not listen to prayers</p>
	<p id="IL.13.303">from both sides, but give the glory to one side or the other:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.304">such were Meriones and Idomeneus, leaders of armies,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.305">as they went on into the fighting helmed in the bright bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.306">First of the two, Meriones, spoke his word to Idomeneus:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.307">'Deukalides, where are you minded to enter the battle?</p>
	<p id="IL.13.308">Would it be on the right of the whole array, or in the centre,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.309">or to the left? Since I think that nowhere else in the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.310">are the flowing-haired Achaians overmatched so badly.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.311">Idomeneus lord of the Kretans answered him in turn:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.312">'There are others beside us to defend the ships in the centre,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.313">the two Aiantes, and Teukros, best of all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.314">in archery, and a good man in the close of standing combat.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.315">They can give Hektor, Priam's son, enough hard hitting,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.316">even though he is very strong, and sweeps hard into battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.317">Furious though he is for fighting, it will be very steep work</p>
	<p id="IL.13.318">for him to win through their irresistible hands and their war strength</p>
	<p id="IL.13.319">and fire the ships, unless the son of Kronos in person</p>
	<p id="IL.13.320">should hurl the blazing firebrand into our fast-running vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.321">Nor would huge Telamonian Aias give way to any man,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.322">one who was mortal and ate bread, the yield of Demeter,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.323">one who could be broken by the bronze and great stones flung at him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.324">He would not make way for Achilleus who breaks men in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.325">in close combat. For speed of feet none can strive with Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.326">Hold, as you say, for the left of the army, and thus soonest</p>
	<p id="IL.13.327">shall we see whether we win glory or give it to others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.328">He spoke, and Meriones, a match for the running war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.329">led the way, till they came to the place in the army he spoke for.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.330">These, as they saw Idomeneus like a flame in his valour</p>
	<p id="IL.13.331">himself and his henchman with him in their elaborate war gear,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.332">they called out across the battle and gathered about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.333">and an indiscriminate fight rose up by the sterns of the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.334">And as when under the screaming winds the whirlstorms bluster</p>
	<p id="IL.13.335">on that day when the dust lies deepest along the pathways</p>
	<p id="IL.13.336">and the winds in the confusion of dust uplift a great cloud,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.337">such was their indiscriminate battle, and their hearts were furious</p>
	<p id="IL.13.338">to slaughter each other with the sharp bronze through the press of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.339">The battle where men perish shuddered now with the long</p>
	<p id="IL.13.340">man-tearing spears they held in their hands, their eyes were blinded</p>
	<p id="IL.13.341">in the dazzle of the bronze light from the glittering helmets,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.342">from the burnished corselets and the shining shields as men came on</p>
	<p id="IL.13.343">in confusion. That man would have to be very bold-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.13.344">who could be cheerful and not stricken looking on that struggle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.345">Two powerful sons of Kronos, hearts divided against each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.346">were wreaking bitter agonies on the fighting warriors,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.347">since Zeus willed the victory for the Trojans and Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.348">glorifying swift-footed Achilleus, yet not utterly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.349">did he wish the Achaian people to be destroyed before Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.350">but only was giving glory to Thetis and her strong-spirited</p>
	<p id="IL.13.351">son, while Poseidon emerging unseen from the grey salt water</p>
	<p id="IL.13.352">went among the Argives and stirred them, since he was angered</p>
	<p id="IL.13.353">that they were beaten by the Trojans and blamed Zeus for it bitterly.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.354">Indeed, the two were of one generation and a single father,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.355">but Zeus was the elder born and knew more. Therefore Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.13.356">shrank from openly defending them, but secretly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.357">in a man's likeness was forever stirring them up through the army.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.358">So these two had looped over both sides a crossing</p>
	<p id="IL.13.359">cable of strong discord and the closing of battle, not to be</p>
	<p id="IL.13.360">slipped, not to be broken, which unstrung the knees of many.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.361">There Idomeneus, greying though he was, called on the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.13.362">and charged in upon the Trojans and drove panic among them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.363">for he killed Othryoneus, a man who had lived in Kabesos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.364">who was newly come in the wake of the rumour of war, and had asked</p>
	<p id="IL.13.365">Priam for the hand of the loveliest of his daughters,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.366">Kassandra, without bride price, but had promised a great work for her,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.367">to drive back the unwilling sons of the Achaians from Troy land,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.368">and aged Priam had bent his head in assent, and promised</p>
	<p id="IL.13.369">to give her, so Othryoneus fought in the faith of his promises.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.370">Idomeneus aimed at him with the shining spear, and threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.371">and hit him as he came onward with high stride, and the corselet</p>
	<p id="IL.13.372">of bronze he wore could not hold, the spear fixed in the middle belly.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.373">He fell, thunderously, and Idomeneus vaunting cried out:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.374">'Othryoneus, I congratulate you beyond all others</p>
	<p id="IL.13.375">if it is here that you will bring to pass what you promised</p>
	<p id="IL.13.376">to Dardanian Priam, who in turn promised you his daughter.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.377">See now, we also would make you a promise, and we would fulfil it;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.378">we would give you the loveliest of Atreides' daughters,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.379">and bring her here from Argos to be your wife, if you joined us</p>
	<p id="IL.13.380">and helped us storm the strong-founded city of Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.381">Come then with me, so we can meet by our seafaring vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.13.382">about a marriage; we here are not bad matchmakers for you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.383">The hero Idomeneus spoke and dragged him through the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.13.384">caught by the foot, but now Asios came to stand by him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.385">dismounted, ahead of his horses whom his henchman held ever behind him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.386">so that they breathed on his shoulders. He was striving in all his fury</p>
	<p id="IL.13.387">to strike Idomeneus, but he, too quick with a spearcast,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.388">struck him in the gorge underneath the chin, and drove the bronze clean through.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.389">He fell, as when an oak goes down or a white poplar</p>
	<p id="IL.13.390">or like a towering pine tree which in the mountains the carpenters</p>
	<p id="IL.13.391">have hewn down with their whetted axes to make a ship timber.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.392">So he lay there felled in front of his horses and chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.393">roaring, and clawed with his hands at the bloody dust. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.13.394">the charioteer who was close behind him was stricken in the wits</p>
	<p id="IL.13.395">and shrinking from the hands of the enemy did not have daring</p>
	<p id="IL.13.396">to turn the horses about, but Antilochos stubborn in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.397">pinned him through the middle with a spearstroke, and the corselet</p>
	<p id="IL.13.398">of bronze he wore could not hold, the spear fixed in the middle belly,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.399">so that he tumbled, gasping, out of the strong-wrought chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.400">But for the horses, Antilochos, son of great-hearted Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.401">drove them away from the Trojans among the strong-greaved Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.402">Deïphobos in sorrow for Asios now came close</p>
	<p id="IL.13.403">in on Idomeneus, and with the bright spear made a cast at him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.404">but Idomeneus with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.405">since also he was hidden beneath his shield's perfect circle, that shield</p>
	<p id="IL.13.406">he carried, hooped in circles of glaring bronze, and the skins</p>
	<p id="IL.13.407">of oxen, fitted with double cross-stays. He was all gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.13.408">together under this, and the brazen spear shot over him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.409">and the shield gave out a hollow clash as the spear glanced from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.410">Yet Deïphobos made no utterly vain cast from his strong hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.411">but struck Hypsenor, son of Hippasos, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.412">in the liver under the midriff, and at once took the strength from his knees.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.413">And Deïphobos vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.414">'Asios lies not now all unavenged. I think rather</p>
	<p id="IL.13.415">as he goes down to Hades of the Gates, the strong one,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.416">he will be cheerful at heart, since I have sent him an escort.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.417">He spoke, and sorrow came over the Argives at his vaunting,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.418">and beyond others stirred the spirit in wise Antilochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.419">yet sorrowful though he was he did not forget his companion</p>
	<p id="IL.13.420">but running stood and bestrode him and covered him under the great shield.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.421">Thereon Mekisteus, son of Echios, and brilliant Alastor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.422">two staunch companions, stooping beneath it, caught up Hypsenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.423">and carried him, groaning heavily, to the hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.424">Idomeneus did not slacken his great fury, but always</p>
	<p id="IL.13.425">was straining to shroud some one of the Trojans in dark night</p>
	<p id="IL.13.426">or go down crashing himself as he fought the bane from the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.427">There was a man, loved son of illustrious Aisyetes,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.428">the hero Alkathoös, who was son-in-law of Anchises,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.429">and had married the eldest of his daughters, Hippodameia,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.430">dear to the hearts of her father and the lady her mother</p>
	<p id="IL.13.431">in the great house, since she surpassed all the girls of her own age</p>
	<p id="IL.13.432">for beauty and accomplishments and wit; for which reason</p>
	<p id="IL.13.433">the man married her who was the best in the wide Troad.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.434">But now Poseidon beat him down at the hands of Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.435">for he bewitched his shining eyes, made moveless his bright limbs,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.436">so that he could not run backward, neither evade him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.437">but stood like a statue or a tree with leaves towering</p>
	<p id="IL.13.438">motionless, while fighting Idomeneus stabbed at the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.439">of his chest with the spear, and broke the bronze armour about him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.440">which in time before had guarded his body from destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.441">He cried out then, a great cry, broken, the spear in him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.442">and fell, thunderously, and the spear in his heart was stuck fast</p>
	<p id="IL.13.443">but the heart was panting still and beating to shake the butt end</p>
	<p id="IL.13.444">of the spear. Then and there Ares the huge took his life away from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.445">Idomeneus vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.446">'Deïphobos, are we then to call this a worthy bargain,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.447">three men killed for one? It was you yourself were so boastful.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.448">Strange man. Do you rather come yourself and stand up against me</p>
	<p id="IL.13.449">so you can see what I am like, Zeus' seed, come here to face you.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.450">Since Zeus first got by Krete Minos, who cared for his people,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.451">and to Minos in turn was born a blameless son, Deukalion,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.452">and Deukalion sired me to be lord over many people</p>
	<p id="IL.13.453">in wide Krete, and now my ships have brought me to this place</p>
	<p id="IL.13.454">to be an evil for you and your father and the rest of the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.455">So he spoke, and the heart in Deïphobos was divided,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.456">pondering whether to draw back and find some other high-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.13.457">Trojan to be his companion, or whether to attempt him singly.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.458">And in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.459">to go for Aineias. He found him at the uttermost edge of the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.460">standing, since he was forever angry with brilliant Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.13.461">because great as he was he did him no honour among his people.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.462">Deïphobos came and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.463">'Aineias, lord of the Trojans' counsels, now there is need of you</p>
	<p id="IL.13.464">to stand by your brother-in-law, if this bond of kinship touches you.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.465">Come then, stand by Alkathoös, who was your sister's husband</p>
	<p id="IL.13.466">and in time past nursed you in his house when you were still little.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.467">But now Idomeneus the spear-famed has killed him in battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.468">So he spoke, and stirred the anger in the breast of Aineias.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.469">He went against Idomeneus, strongly eager for battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.470">yet no fear gripped Idomeneus as if he were a stripling,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.471">but he stood his ground like a mountain wild boar who in the confidence</p>
	<p id="IL.13.472">of his strength stands up to a great rabble of men advancing</p>
	<p id="IL.13.473">upon him in some deserted place, and bristles his back up,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.474">and both his eyes are shining with fire; he grinds his teeth</p>
	<p id="IL.13.475">in his fury to fight off the dogs and the men. So</p>
	<p id="IL.13.476">spear-famed Idomeneus held his ground, and would not give way</p>
	<p id="IL.13.477">to Aineias coming against him, but bellowed to his companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.478">looking to Askalaphos, and Aphareus, and Deïpyros,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.479">at Meriones and Antilochos, both urgent for battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.480">and stirring all these forward called out to them in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.481">'This way, friends, stand by me, I am alone, and terribly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.482">I fear the attack of swift-footed Aineias advancing upon me,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.483">powerful as he is for the slaying of men in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.484">Likewise the flower of youth is his, where man's strength is highest,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.485">since were we two of the same age, and in this same spirit,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.486">soon he would win me in a great battle, or I would win him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.487">So he spoke, and all these, a single spirit within them,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.488">came and stood in their numbers and sloped their shields over his shoulders,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.489">and Aineias on the other side called to his own companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.490">looking to Deïphobos, and Paris, and brilliant Agenor</p>
	<p id="IL.13.491">who were lords of the Trojans along with him, and the people after them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.492">followed on, as when the sheep follow the lead-ram</p>
	<p id="IL.13.493">as they leave the pasture to drink, and make proud the heart of the shepherd,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.494">and thus also the heart of Aineias was gladdened within him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.495">as he saw the swarm of the host following his own leadership.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.496">These then drove on in close combat about Alkathoös</p>
	<p id="IL.13.497">with long spears, and the bronze girding the chests of the fighters</p>
	<p id="IL.13.498">clashed horribly to the spears they threw in the press at each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.499">and two men, for warcraft pre-eminent beyond the others,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.500">Aineias and Idomeneus, both men like the war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.501">were straining with the pitiless bronze to tear at each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.502">Aineias was first with a spear cast at Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.503">but he, keeping his eyes straight on him, avoided the bronze spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.504">so that the vibrant shaft of Aineias was driven groundward</p>
	<p id="IL.13.505">since it had been thrown in a vain cast from his big hand.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.506">But Idomeneus hit Oinomaos in the middle belly</p>
	<p id="IL.13.507">and broke the hollow of the corselet, so that the entrails spurted</p>
	<p id="IL.13.508">from the bronze, and he fell clawing the dust in his fingers.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.509">Idomeneus wrenched out the far-shadowing spear from his body</p>
	<p id="IL.13.510">but had no power to strip the rest of his splendid armour</p>
	<p id="IL.13.511">away from his shoulders, since he was beaten back by their missiles,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.512">and no longer in an outrush could his limbs stay steady beneath him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.513">either to dash in after his spear, or to get clear again.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.514">So in close-standing fight he beat off the pitiless death-day</p>
	<p id="IL.13.515">as his feet no longer quick to run took him out of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.516">As he backed slowly Deïphobos made a cast with the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.13.517">spear, since he held a fixed hatred forever against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.518">but missed him yet once again and struck down with the spear the war god's</p>
	<p id="IL.13.519">son Askalaphos, so that the powerful spear was driven</p>
	<p id="IL.13.520">through his shoulder, and he dropping in the dust clawed the ground in his fingers.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.521">But Ares the huge and bellowing had yet heard nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.13.522">of how his son had fallen there in the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.13.523">but he, sheltered under the golden clouds on utmost Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.524">was sitting, held fast by command of Zeus, where the rest also</p>
	<p id="IL.13.525">of the immortal gods were sitting still, in restraint from the battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.526">But the men drove on in close combat about Askalaphos.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.527">Deïphobos tore from Askalaphos the shining helmet;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.528">but now Meriones, a match for the running war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.529">plunging upon him stabbed his arm with the spear, and the hollow-eyed</p>
	<p id="IL.13.530">helmet dropped from his hand and fell to the ground clashing.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.531">Meriones in yet another swoop like a vulture</p>
	<p id="IL.13.532">plucked out the heavy spear from the arm's base at the shoulder,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.533">then shrank into the host of his own companions. Polites,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.534">Deïphobos' brother, caught him about the waist with both arms</p>
	<p id="IL.13.535">and got him out of the sorrowful fighting, and reached his fast-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.13.536">horses, where they stood to the rear of the fighting and the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.537">holding their charioteer and the elaborate chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.538">and these carried him, groaning heavily, back to the city</p>
	<p id="IL.13.539">in pain, since the blood was running from his arm's fresh wound.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.540">But the rest fought on with clamour incessant rising about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.541">There Aineias lunging at Aphareus, the son of Kaletor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.542">struck him with the sharp spear in the throat where it was turned toward him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.543">His head bent over to one side, and his shield tumbled,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.544">and the helm, and death breaking the spirit drifted about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.545">Antilochos, watching Thoön as he turned about, dashed in on him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.546">and slashed at him, and shore away the entire vein</p>
	<p id="IL.13.547">which runs all the way up the back till it reaches the neck. This</p>
	<p id="IL.13.548">he shore away entire, so he sprawled in the dust backward,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.549">reaching out both hands to his beloved companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.550">Antilochos rushed on him, trying to strip the armour</p>
	<p id="IL.13.551">from his shoulders, but watchful, as the Trojans gathered about him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.552">from all sides, and beat at the shining broad shield, but could not</p>
	<p id="IL.13.553">get within it and tear with the pitiless bronze Antilochos'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.554">tender flesh, for about him the earth-shaker Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.13.555">guarded the son of Nestor even in the swarm of missiles.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.556">Since he was not making his way back clear of the enemy,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.557">but would turn to face them nor held motionless his spear, always</p>
	<p id="IL.13.558">it was shaken or driven forward, the desire in his heart forever</p>
	<p id="IL.13.559">to strike someone with a spearcast or drive at him in close combat.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.560">Adamas, Asios' son, was not blind to how he kept aiming</p>
	<p id="IL.13.561">with his spear in the battle, and charging close stabbed with the sharp bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.13.562">at the shield's middle, but Poseidon the dark-haired made void</p>
	<p id="IL.13.563">his spear's stroke, nor would let him win the life of Antilochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.564">and half of the spear was stuck fast like a stake fire-hardened</p>
	<p id="IL.13.565">in Antilochos' shield, and the other half lay on the ground.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.566">To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.567">but as he went back Meriones dogging him threw with the spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.568">and struck between navel and genitals where beyond all places</p>
	<p id="IL.13.569">death in battle comes painfully to pitiful mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.570">There the spear stuck fast driven and he, writhing about it,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.571">gasped as an ox does when among the mountains the herdsmen</p>
	<p id="IL.13.572">have bound him strongly in twisted ropes and drag him unwilling.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.573">So he, stricken, gasped for a little while, but not long,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.574">until fighting Meriones came close and wrenched the spear out</p>
	<p id="IL.13.575">from his body, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.576">But Helenos closing struck Deïpyros on the temple</p>
	<p id="IL.13.577">with a huge Thracian sword, and broke the helmet to pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.13.578">so that it was knocked off and fell to the ground. An Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.13.579">picked it up where it rolled among the feet of the fighters;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.580">but the darkness of night misted over the eyes of Deïpyros.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.581">Then sorrow caught Atreus' son Menelaos of the great war cry,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.582">and he came on menacing and shaking his sharp spear at Helenos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.583">the lord and fighter, who pulled against him the bow at the handgrip,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.584">and both let fly at each other together, one with a sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.585">in a javelin cast, and one with the arrow from the bowstring.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.586">The son of Priam hit him then on the chest with an arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.13.587">in the hollow of the corselet, but the bitter arrow sprang far back.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.588">As along a great threshing floor from the broad blade</p>
	<p id="IL.13.589">of a shovel the black-skinned beans and the chickpeas bounce high</p>
	<p id="IL.13.590">under the whistling blast and the sweep of the winnowing fan, so</p>
	<p id="IL.13.591">back from the corselet of glorious Menelaos the bitter</p>
	<p id="IL.13.592">arrow rebounded far away, being driven hard back.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.593">But Atreus' son Menelaos of the great war cry struck him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.594">in the hand where he held the polished bow, and the bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.595">was driven clean on through the bow and the hand beyond it.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.596">To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.597">dangling his wounded hand and dragging the ash spear with it.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.598">But great-hearted Agenor drew from his hand the spear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.599">and bound up his hand with a careful twist of wool fleece</p>
	<p id="IL.13.600">in a sling the henchman held for the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.601">Peisandros now came on straight against Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.602">the glorious, but an evil destiny led him toward death's end,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.603">to be beaten down by you, Menelaos, in the stark encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.604">Now when these in their advance were close to each other</p>
	<p id="IL.13.605">the son of Atreus missed with his throw, and the spear was turned past him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.606">but Peisandros stabbed with the spear at the shield of glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.13.607">Menelaos, but could not drive the bronze all the way through it</p>
	<p id="IL.13.608">for the wide shield held against it and the spearshaft was broken</p>
	<p id="IL.13.609">behind the head, yet he was light-hearted and hopeful of victory.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.610">Drawing his sword with the silver nails, the son of Atreus</p>
	<p id="IL.13.611">sprang at Peisandros, who underneath his shield's cover gripped</p>
	<p id="IL.13.612">his beautiful axe with strong bronze blade upon a long polished</p>
	<p id="IL.13.613">axe-handle of olive wood. They made their strokes at the same time</p>
	<p id="IL.13.614">and Peisandros chopped at the horn of the helmet crested with horse-hair</p>
	<p id="IL.13.615">at the very peak. Menelaos struck him as he came onward</p>
	<p id="IL.13.616">in the forehead over the base of the nose, and smashed the bones, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.13.617">both eyes dropped, bloody, and lay in the dust at his feet before him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.618">He fell, curling, and Menelaos, setting his heel on</p>
	<p id="IL.13.619">his chest, stripped off his armour and spoke exulting over him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.620">'So, I think, shall you leave the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.621">you haughty Trojans, never to be glutted with the grim war noises,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.622">nor go short of all that other shame and defilement</p>
	<p id="IL.13.623">wherewith you defiled me, wretched dogs, and your hearts knew no fear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.624">at all of the hard anger of Zeus loud-thundering,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.625">the guest's god, who some day will utterly sack your steep city.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.626">You who in vanity went away taking with you my wedded</p>
	<p id="IL.13.627">wife, and many possessions, when she had received you in kindness.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.628">And now once more you rage among our seafaring vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.13.629">to throw deadly fire on them and kill the fighting Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.630">But you will be held somewhere, though you be so headlong for battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.631">Father Zeus, they say your wisdom passes all others',</p>
	<p id="IL.13.632">of men and gods, and yet from you all this is accomplished</p>
	<p id="IL.13.633">the way you give these outrageous people your grace, these Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.13.634">whose fighting strength is a thing of blind fury, nor can they ever</p>
	<p id="IL.13.635">be glutted full of the close encounters of deadly warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.636">Since there is satiety in all things, in sleep, and love-making,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.637">in the loveliness of singing and the innocent dance. In all these</p>
	<p id="IL.13.638">things a man will strive sooner to win satisfaction</p>
	<p id="IL.13.639">than in war; but in this the Trojans cannot be glutted.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.640">So Menelaos the blameless spoke, and stripping the bloody</p>
	<p id="IL.13.641">armour away from his body gave it to his companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.642">and turned back himself to merge in the ranks of the champions.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.643">Now there sprang forth against him the son of King Pylaimenes,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.644">Harpalion, who had followed his father into the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.645">at Troy, and did not come home again to the land of his fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.646">He from close up stabbed with his spear at the shield of Atreides</p>
	<p id="IL.13.647">in the middle, but could not drive the bronze all the way through it.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.648">To avoid death he shrank into the host of his own companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.649">looking all about him, for fear somebody might wound him with the bronze;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.650">but as he went back Meriones let fly at him with a bronze-shod</p>
	<p id="IL.13.651">arrow, and hit him beside the right buttock, so that the arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.13.652">was driven on through under the bone to fix in the bladder.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.653">There, sitting among the arms of his beloved companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.654">he gasped out his life, then lay like a worm extended</p>
	<p id="IL.13.655">along the ground, and his dark blood drenched the ground in its running.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.656">And the great-hearted Paphlagonians busied about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.657">lifted him into a chariot and brought him to sacred Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.13.658">in sorrow, and his father, weeping tears, walked beside them,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.659">and no man-price came his way for his son's slaying.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.660">But Paris was deeply angered at heart for this man's slaying,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.661">since he was his guest friend among many Paphlagonians,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.662">and in anger for him he also let fly a bronze-shod arrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.663">There was a man, Euchenor, son of the seer Polyidos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.664">a rich man and good, who lived in his house at Korinth,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.665">who knew well that it was his death when he went on shipboard,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.666">since many times the good old man Polyidos had told him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.667">that he must die in his own house of a painful sickness</p>
	<p id="IL.13.668">or go with the ships of the Achaians and be killed by the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.669">He therefore chose to avoid the troublesome price the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.670">would ask, and the hateful sickness so his heart might not be afflicted.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.671">Paris struck him by jaw and ear, and at once the life spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.13.672">fled from his limbs, and the hateful darkness closed in about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.673">So they fought on in the likeness of blazing fire. But meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.13.674">Hektor beloved of Zeus had not heard of this, and knew nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.13.675">of how to the left of the ships his people were being slaughtered</p>
	<p id="IL.13.676">by the Argives, and glory for the Achaians might even have been</p>
	<p id="IL.13.677">accomplished, such was Poseidon who circles the earth and shakes it</p>
	<p id="IL.13.678">as he stirred on the Argives and fought for them and his own strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.679">But Hektor held where first he had broken a way through the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.13.680">and the gates, and shattered the close ranks of the armoured Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.681">where lay the ships of Aias and the ships of Protesilaos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.682">hauled up along the beach of the grey sea; and above these</p>
	<p id="IL.13.683">the wall they had built lay lowest, and there beyond other places</p>
	<p id="IL.13.684">dangerous was the onslaught of the Trojans and of their horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.685">There the Boiotians, and Ionians with their trailing tunics,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.686">the Lokrians and the Phthians, with the shining Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.687">tried to hold him as he swept hard for the ships, but they could not</p>
	<p id="IL.13.688">avail to beat brilliant flame-like Hektor back from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.689">There also were the chosen Athenian men, and among them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.690">Peteos' son Menestheus was lord, and there followed with him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.691">Pheidas and Stichios and strong Bias; but the Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.692">were led by Meges, Phyleus' son, Amphion and Drakios,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.693">and before the Phthians were Medon and battle-stubborn Podarkes.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.694">Now of these one, Medon, was bastard son of Oïleus</p>
	<p id="IL.13.695">the godlike, and brother of Aias, yet he was living away from</p>
	<p id="IL.13.696">the land of his fathers, in Phylake, since he had killed a man,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.697">the brother of Eriopis, his stepmother and wife of Oïleus;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.698">but the other was son of Iphiklos, the son of Phylakos.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.699">And these in arms at the forefront of the great-hearted Phthians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.700">fought beside the Boiotians in defence of their vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.701">But swift Aias the son of Oïleus would not at all now</p>
	<p id="IL.13.702">take his stand apart from Telamonian Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.703">not even a little; but as two wine-coloured oxen straining</p>
	<p id="IL.13.704">with even force drag the compacted plough through the fallow land,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.705">and for both of them at the base of the horns the dense sweat gushes;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.706">only the width of the polished yoke keeps a space between them</p>
	<p id="IL.13.707">as they toil down the furrow till the share cuts the edge of the ploughland;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.708">so these took their stand in battle, close to each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.709">Now with the son of Telamon many people and brave ones</p>
	<p id="IL.13.710">followed as companions, and took over the great shield from him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.711">whenever the sweat and the weariness came over his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.712">But no Lokrians went with the great-hearted son of Oïleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.713">The heart was not in them to endure close-standing combat,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.714">for they did not have the brazen helmets crested with horse-hair,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.715">they did not have the strong-circled shields and the ash spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.716">but rather these had followed to Ilion with all their confidence</p>
	<p id="IL.13.717">in their bows and slings strong-twisted of wool; and with these</p>
	<p id="IL.13.718">they shot their close volleys and broke the Trojan battalions.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.719">So now these others fought in front in elaborate war gear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.720">against the Trojans and Hektor the brazen-helmed, and the Lokrians</p>
	<p id="IL.13.721">unseen volleyed from behind, so the Trojans remembered</p>
	<p id="IL.13.722">nothing of the joy of battle, since the shafts struck them to confusion.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.723">Now pitifully the Trojans might have gone back from the shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.13.724">and the ships, to windy Ilion, had not Poulydamas</p>
	<p id="IL.13.725">come and stood beside bold Hektor and spoken a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.726">'Hektor, you are too intractable to listen to reason.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.727">Because the god has granted you the actions of warfare</p>
	<p id="IL.13.728">therefore you wish in counsel also to be wise beyond others.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.729">But you cannot choose to have all gifts given to you together.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.730">To one man the god has granted the actions of warfare,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.731">to one to be a dancer, to another the lyre and the singing,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.732">and in the breast of another Zeus of the wide brows establishes</p>
	<p id="IL.13.733">wisdom, a lordly thing, and many take profit beside him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.734">and he saves many, but the man's own thought surpasses all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.735">Now I will tell you the way that it seems best to my mind.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.736">For you, everywhere the fighting burns in a circle around you,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.737">but of the great-hearted Trojans since they crossed over the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.13.738">some are standing back in their war gear, others are fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.739">fewer men against many, being scattered among the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.740">Draw back now, and call to this place all of our bravest,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.741">and then we might work out together our general counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.742">whether we can fall upon their benched ships, if the god might</p>
	<p id="IL.13.743">be willing to give such power to us, or whether thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.13.744">we can win away from the ships unhurt; since I fear</p>
	<p id="IL.13.745">the Achaians might wreak on us requital for yesterday;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.746">since beside their ships lurks a man insatiate of fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.747">and I think we can no longer utterly hold him from the fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.748">So spoke Poulydamas, and this counsel of safety pleased Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.749">and at once in all his armour he leapt to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.13.750">and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: 'Poulydamas,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.751">do you rather call back to their place all of our bravest.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.752">I am going over there to meet the attack, and afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.13.753">I will come back soon, when I have properly given my orders.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.754">So he spoke, and went on his way like a snowy mountain,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.755">calling aloud, and swept through the Trojans and their companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.756">But the rest of them rallied quickly around the son of Panthoös,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.757">courtly Poulydamas, each as they heard the command of Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.758">But Hektor ranged the ranks of the foremost fighters, searching</p>
	<p id="IL.13.759">for Deïphobos, and the strength of Helenos the prince, and for Asios'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.760">son Adamas, and Asios, Hyrtakos' son, if he might</p>
	<p id="IL.13.761">find them; but found them no longer utterly unwounded or living,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.762">but some were lying along the sterns of Achaian vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.763">they who had lost their lives at the hands of the Argives, and others</p>
	<p id="IL.13.764">were lying away inside the city with arrow or spear wounds.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.765">But he found one man away to the left of the sorrowful battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.766">brilliant Alexandros, the lord of lovely-haired Helen,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.767">encouraging his companions and urging them on into battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.768">Hektor came and stood near, and in words of shame he rebuked him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.769">'Evil Paris, beautiful, woman-crazy, cajoling:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.770">where is Deïphobos gone, and the strength of the prince Helenos,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.771">Adamas, Asios' son, and Asios, son of Hyrtakos?</p>
	<p id="IL.13.772">Where is Othryoneus? Now all steep Ilion is lost</p>
	<p id="IL.13.773">utterly; now your own headlong destruction is certain.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.774">Then in turn Alexandros the godlike answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.775">'Hektor, since it is your pleasure to blame me when I am blameless,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.776">it would be better some other time to withdraw from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.13.777">than now. My mother bore me not utterly lacking in warcraft.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.778">For since that time when by the ships you wakened the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.13.779">of our companions, we have stayed here and fought the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.13.780">without end. And our companions are killed you ask for.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.781">Only Deïphobos and the strength of the prince Helenos</p>
	<p id="IL.13.782">have gone away, wounded each in the hand by strokes</p>
	<p id="IL.13.783">of the long spears, but the son of Kronos fended death from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.784">Now lead on, wherever your heart and spirit command you,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.785">and we shall follow you eagerly; I think that we shall not</p>
	<p id="IL.13.786">come short in warcraft, in so far as the strength stays with us.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.787">But beyond his strength no man can fight, although he be eager.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.788">So the hero spoke, and persuaded the heart of his brother.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.789">They went on, to where the clamour and fighting were greatest,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.790">about Kebriones, and Poulydamas the blameless,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.791">about Phalkes, and Orthaios, and godlike Polyphetes,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.792">Palmys, with Askanios and Morys, sons of Hippotion,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.793">who had come over in their turn from fertile Askania</p>
	<p id="IL.13.794">on the dawn before, and now Zeus stirred them into the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.795">They went on, as out of the racking winds the stormblast</p>
	<p id="IL.13.796">that underneath the thunderstroke of Zeus father drives downward</p>
	<p id="IL.13.797">and with gigantic clamour hits the sea, and the numerous</p>
	<p id="IL.13.798">boiling waves along the length of the roaring water</p>
	<p id="IL.13.799">bend and whiten to foam in ranks, one upon another;</p>
	<p id="IL.13.800">so the Trojans closing in ranks, some leading and others</p>
	<p id="IL.13.801">after them, in the glare of bronze armour followed their leaders.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.802">And Hektor led them, Priam's son, a man like the murderous</p>
	<p id="IL.13.803">war god, and held the perfect circle of his shield before him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.804">fenced deep in skins, with a great fold of bronze beaten upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.805">and about his temples was shaken as he went the glittering helmet.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.806">He would step forward, to probe the Achaian battalions at all points,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.807">if they might give way where he stalked on under his shield's cover,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.808">but could not so confuse the heart in the breasts of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.809">Aias was first to take long strides forward and challenge him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.810">'Man, you are mad. Come closer. Why try this way to terrify</p>
	<p id="IL.13.811">the Argives? It is not that we are so unskilled in fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.812">but by the wicked whiplash of Zeus we Achaians are beaten.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.813">I suppose, then, your heart is hopeful utterly to break up</p>
	<p id="IL.13.814">our ships? We too have prompt hands among us strong to defend them.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.815">Rather, far before this your own strong-founded citadel</p>
	<p id="IL.13.816">must go down under our hands, stormed and utterly taken.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.817">And for yourself I say that the time is close, when in flight</p>
	<p id="IL.13.818">you will pray to Zeus father and the other immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.13.819">that your bright-maned horses might be swifter than hawks are</p>
	<p id="IL.13.820">as they carry you through the stirred dust of the plain to your city.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.821">As he spoke so, an ominous bird winged by at his right hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.822">a towering eagle, and the host of the Achaians, made brave</p>
	<p id="IL.13.823">by the bird sign, shouted, but glorious Hektor answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.13.824">'Aias, you inarticulate ox, what is this you have spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.13.825">If I could only be called son to Zeus of the aegis</p>
	<p id="IL.13.826">all the days of my life, and the lady Hera my mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.827">and I be honoured, as Apollo and Athene are honoured,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.828">so surely as this is a day that brings evil to the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.829">all, and you will be killed with the rest of them, if you have daring</p>
	<p id="IL.13.830">to stand up against my long spear, which will bite your delicate</p>
	<p id="IL.13.831">body; yet then you will glut the dogs and birds of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.13.832">with fat and flesh, struck down beside the ships of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.13.833">So he spoke and led the way, and the rest of them followed him</p>
	<p id="IL.13.834">with unearthly clamour, and all the people shouted behind him.</p>
	<p id="IL.13.835">But the Argives on the other side cried out, and would not</p>
	<p id="IL.13.836">forget their warcraft, but stood the attack of the bravest Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.13.837">and the clamour from both was driven high to Zeus' shining aether.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.1">Now Nestor failed not to hear their outcry, though he was drinking</p>
	<p id="IL.14.2">his wine, but spoke in winged words to the son of Asklepios:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.3">'Take thought how these things shall be done, brilliant Machaon.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.4">Beside the ships the cry of the strong young men grows greater.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.5">Now, do you sit here and go on drinking the bright wine,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.6">until Hekamede the lovely-haired makes ready a hot bath</p>
	<p id="IL.14.7">for you, warming it, and washes away the filth of the bloodstains,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.8">while I go out and make my way till I find some watchpoint.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.9">So he spoke, and took up the wrought shield of his son</p>
	<p id="IL.14.10">Thrasymedes, breaker of horses. It lay in the shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.14.11">all shining in bronze. Thrasymedes carried the shield of his father.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.12">Then he caught up a powerful spear edged in sharp bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.14.13">and stood outside the shelter, and at once saw a shameful action,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.14">men driven to flight, and others harrying them in confusion,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.15">the great-hearted Trojans, and the wall of the Achaians overthrown.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.16">As when the open sea is deeply stirred to the ground-swell</p>
	<p id="IL.14.17">but stays in one place and waits the rapid onset of tearing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.18">gusts, nor rolls its surf onward in either direction</p>
	<p id="IL.14.19">until from Zeus the wind is driven down to decide it;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.20">so the aged man pondered, his mind caught between two courses,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.21">whether to go among the throng of fast-mounted Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.14.22">or in search of Atreus' son Agamemnon, shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.23">And in the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.24">to go after the son of Atreus, while the rest went on with the murderous</p>
	<p id="IL.14.25">battle, and the weariless bronze about their bodies was clashing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.26">as the men were stabbing with swords and leaf-headed spears.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.27">Now there came toward Nestor the kings under God's hand, they who</p>
	<p id="IL.14.28">had been wounded by the bronze and came back along the ships, Tydeus'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.29">son, and Odysseus, and Atreus' son Agamemnon. For there</p>
	<p id="IL.14.30">were ships that had been hauled up far away from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.14.31">along the beach of the grey sea. They had hauled up the first ones</p>
	<p id="IL.14.32">on the plain, and by the sterns of these had built their defences;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.33">for, wide as it was, the sea-shore was not big enough to make room</p>
	<p id="IL.14.34">for all the ships, and the people also were straitened; and therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.14.35">they had hauled them up in depth, and filled up the long edge</p>
	<p id="IL.14.36">of the whole sea-coast, all that the two capes compassed between them.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.37">These lords walked in a group, each leaning on his spear, to look at</p>
	<p id="IL.14.38">the clamorous battle, and for each the heart inside his body</p>
	<p id="IL.14.39">was sorrowful; and Nestor the aged man who now met them</p>
	<p id="IL.14.40">made still more cast down the spirit inside the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.41">Now powerful Agamemnon spoke aloud and addressed him:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.42">'Nestor, son of Neleus, great glory of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.43">why have you left the fighting where men die, and come back here?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.44">I am afraid huge Hektor may accomplish that word against me</p>
	<p id="IL.14.45">that he spoke, threatening, among the Trojans assembled,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.46">that he would not make his way back from the ships toward Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.14.47">until he had set the ships on fire, and killed the men in them.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.48">So he spoke then; now all these things are being accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.49">Oh, shame, for I think that all the other strong-greaved Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.14.50">are storing anger against me in their hearts, as Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.14.51">did, and no longer will fight for me by the grounded vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.52">Then answered him in turn the Gerenian horseman Nestor:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.53">'All these things have been brought to fulfilment, nor in any other</p>
	<p id="IL.14.54">way could even Zeus who thunders on high accomplish it.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.55">For the wall has gone down in which we put our trust, that it</p>
	<p id="IL.14.56">would be a protection for our ships and us, and could not be broken,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.57">and our men beside the fast ships are fighting incessantly</p>
	<p id="IL.14.58">without end, nor could you tell any more, though you looked hard,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.59">from which side the Achaians are broken into confusion,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.60">so indiscriminately are they killed, and their crying goes skyward.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.61">We then must take thought together how these things shall be done</p>
	<p id="IL.14.62">if wit can do anything for us now. I think that we must not</p>
	<p id="IL.14.63">enter the fight; a man cannot fight on when he is wounded.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.64">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.65">'Nestor, since now they are fighting beside the grounded vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.14.66">and the wall we built has done us no good, nor the ditch either</p>
	<p id="IL.14.67">where the Danaans endured so much, and their hearts were hopeful</p>
	<p id="IL.14.68">it would be a protection to their ships and them, and could not be broken,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.69">then such is the way it must be pleasing to Zeus, who is too strong,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.70">that the Achaians must die here forgotten and far from Argos.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.71">For I knew it, when with full heart he defended the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.72">and I know it now, when he glorifies these people as if they</p>
	<p id="IL.14.73">were blessed gods, and has hobbled our warcraft and our hands' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.74">Come then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us</p>
	<p id="IL.14.75">take all those ships that are beached near the sea in the first line</p>
	<p id="IL.14.76">and haul them down, and row them out on the shining water,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.77">and moor them at anchor stones out on the deep water, until</p>
	<p id="IL.14.78">the immortal Night comes down, if the Trojans will give over fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.14.79">for Night's sake; then we might haul down all the rest of our vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.80">There is no shame in running, even by night, from disaster.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.81">The man does better who runs from disaster than he who is caught by it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.82">Then looking darkly at him spoke resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.83">'Son of Atreus, what sort of word escaped your teeth's barrier?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.84">Ruinous! I wish you directed some other unworthy</p>
	<p id="IL.14.85">army, and were not lord over us, over us to whom Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.14.86">has appointed the accomplishing of wars, from our youth</p>
	<p id="IL.14.87">even into our old age until we are dead, each of us.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.88">Are you really thus eager to abandon the wide-wayed city</p>
	<p id="IL.14.89">of the Trojans, over which we have taken so many sorrows?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.90">Do not say it; for fear some other Achaian might hear this</p>
	<p id="IL.14.91">word, which could never at all get past the lips of any man</p>
	<p id="IL.14.92">who understood inside his heart how to speak soundly,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.93">who was a sceptred king, and all the people obeyed him</p>
	<p id="IL.14.94">in numbers like those of the Argives, whose lord you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.95">Now I utterly despise your heart for the thing you have spoken;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.96">you who in the very closing of clamorous battle</p>
	<p id="IL.14.97">tell us to haul our strong-benched ships to the sea, so that even</p>
	<p id="IL.14.98">more glory may befall the Trojans, who beat us already,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.99">and headlong destruction swing our way, since the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.14.100">will not hold their battle as the ships are being hauled seaward,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.101">but will look about, and let go the exultation of fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.102">There, o leader of the people, your plan will be ruin.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.103">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.104">'Odysseus, you have hit me somewhere deep in my feelings</p>
	<p id="IL.14.105">with this hard word. But I am not telling the sons of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.14.106">against their will to drag their benched ships down to the water.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.107">Now let someone speak who has better counsel than this was;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.108">young man or old; and what he says will be to my liking.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.109">Now among them spoke Diomedes of the great war cry:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.110">'That man is here, we shall not look far for him, if you are willing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.111">to listen, and not be each astonished in anger against me</p>
	<p id="IL.14.112">because by birth I am the youngest among you. I also</p>
	<p id="IL.14.113">can boast that my generation is of an excellent father,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.114">Tydeus, whom now the heaped earth covers over in Thebe.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.115">For there were three blameless sons who were born to Portheus,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.116">and their home was in Pleuron and headlong Kalydon. Agrios</p>
	<p id="IL.14.117">was first, then Melas, and the third was Oineus the horseman,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.118">the father of my father, and in valour beyond the others.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.119">But Oineus stayed in the land, while my father was driven and settled</p>
	<p id="IL.14.120">in Argos. Such was the will of Zeus and the other immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.121">He married one of the daughters of Adrestos, and established</p>
	<p id="IL.14.122">a house rich in substance, and plenty of wheat-grown acres</p>
	<p id="IL.14.123">were his, with many orchards of fruit trees circled about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.124">and many herds were his. He surpassed all other Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.14.125">with the spear. If all this is true, you must have heard of it.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.126">Therefore you could not, saying that I was base and unwarlike</p>
	<p id="IL.14.127">by birth, dishonour any word that I speak, if I speak well.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.128">Let us go back to the fighting wounded as we are. We have to.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.129">Once there, we must hold ourselves out of the onfall, clear of</p>
	<p id="IL.14.130">missiles, so that none will add to the wound he has got already,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.131">but we shall be there to drive them on, since even before this</p>
	<p id="IL.14.132">they have favoured their anger, and stood far off, and will not fight for us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.133">So he spoke, and they listened well to him, and obeyed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.134">and went on their way. And the lord of men, Agamemnon, led them.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.135">Neither did the glorious shaker of the earth keep blind watch,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.136">but came among them now in the likeness of an old man,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.137">and took hold of Agamemnon, Atreus' son, by the right hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.138">and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: 'Son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.139">I think that now that baleful heart in the breast of Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.14.140">must be happy as he stares at the slaughter of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.14.141">and their defeat. There is no heart in him, not even a little.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.142">Even so may the god strike him down, let him go to destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.143">But with you the blessed gods are not utterly angry.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.144">There will still be a time when the lords of Troy and their counsellors</p>
	<p id="IL.14.145">shall send dust wide on the plain, and you yourself shall look on them</p>
	<p id="IL.14.146">as they take flight for their city away from the ships and the shelters.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.147">So he spoke, and swept on over the plain, with a huge cry</p>
	<p id="IL.14.148">like the yell nine thousand men send up, or ten thousand</p>
	<p id="IL.14.149">in battle, as they close in the hateful strife of the war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.150">So huge was the cry the powerful earth-shaker let go</p>
	<p id="IL.14.151">from his lungs, and in the heart of every Achaian implanted</p>
	<p id="IL.14.152">great strength, to carry the battle on, and fight without flinching.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.153">Now Hera, she of the golden throne, standing on Olympos'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.154">horn, looked out with her eyes, and saw at once how Poseidon,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.155">who was her very brother and her lord's brother, was bustling</p>
	<p id="IL.14.156">about the battle where men win glory, and her heart was happy.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.157">Then she saw Zeus, sitting along the loftiest summit</p>
	<p id="IL.14.158">on Ida of the springs, and in her eyes he was hateful.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.159">And now the lady ox-eyed Hera was divided in purpose</p>
	<p id="IL.14.160">as to how she could beguile the brain in Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.161">And to her mind this thing appeared to be the best counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.162">to array herself in loveliness, and go down to Ida,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.163">and perhaps he might be taken with desire to lie in love with her</p>
	<p id="IL.14.164">next her skin, and she might be able to drift an innocent</p>
	<p id="IL.14.165">warm sleep across his eyelids, and seal his crafty perceptions.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.166">She went into her chamber, which her beloved son Hephaistos</p>
	<p id="IL.14.167">had built for her, and closed the leaves in the door-posts snugly</p>
	<p id="IL.14.168">with a secret door-bar, and no other of the gods could open it.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.169">There entering she drew shut the leaves of the shining door, then</p>
	<p id="IL.14.170">first from her adorable body washed away all stains</p>
	<p id="IL.14.171">with ambrosia, and next anointed herself with ambrosial</p>
	<p id="IL.14.172">sweet olive oil, which stood there in its fragrance beside her,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.173">and from which, stirred in the house of Zeus by the golden pavement,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.174">a fragrance was shaken forever forth, on earth and in heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.175">When with this she had anointed her delicate body</p>
	<p id="IL.14.176">and combed her hair, next with her hands she arranged the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.14.177">and lovely and ambrosial curls along her immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.14.178">head, and dressed in an ambrosial robe that Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.14.179">had made her carefully, smooth, and with many figures upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.180">and pinned it across her breast with a golden brooch, and circled</p>
	<p id="IL.14.181">her waist about with a zone that floated a hundred tassels,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.182">and in the lobes of her carefully pierced ears she put rings</p>
	<p id="IL.14.183">with triple drops in mulberry clusters, radiant with beauty,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.184">and, lovely among goddesses, she veiled her head downward</p>
	<p id="IL.14.185">with a sweet fresh veil that glimmered pale like the sunlight.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.186">Underneath her shining feet she bound on the fair sandals.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.187">Now, when she had clothed her body in all this loveliness,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.188">she went out from the chamber, and called aside Aphrodite</p>
	<p id="IL.14.189">to come away from the rest of the gods, and spoke a word to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.190">'Would you do something for me, dear child, if I were to ask you?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.191">Or would you refuse it? Are you forever angered against me</p>
	<p id="IL.14.192">because I defend the Danaans, while you help the Trojans?'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.193">Then the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite, answered her: 'Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.194">honoured goddess, daughter to mighty Kronos, speak forth</p>
	<p id="IL.14.195">whatever is in your mind. My heart is urgent to do it</p>
	<p id="IL.14.196">if I can, and if it is a thing that can be accomplished.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.197">Then, with false lying purpose the lady Hera answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.198">'Give me loveliness and desirability, graces</p>
	<p id="IL.14.199">with which you overwhelm mortal men, and all the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.200">Since I go now to the ends of the generous earth, on a visit</p>
	<p id="IL.14.201">to Okeanos, whence the gods have risen, and Tethys our mother</p>
	<p id="IL.14.202">who brought me up kindly in their own house, and cared for me</p>
	<p id="IL.14.203">and took me from Rheia, at that time when Zeus of the wide brows</p>
	<p id="IL.14.204">drove Kronos underneath the earth and the barren water.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.205">I shall go to visit these, and resolve their division of discord,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.206">since now for a long time they have stayed apart from each other</p>
	<p id="IL.14.207">and from the bed of love, since rancour has entered their feelings.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.208">Could I win over with persuasion the dear heart within them</p>
	<p id="IL.14.209">and bring them back to their bed to be merged in love with each other</p>
	<p id="IL.14.210">I shall be forever called honoured by them, and beloved.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.211">Then in turn Aphrodite the laughing answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.212">'I cannot, and I must not deny this thing that you ask for,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.213">you, who lie in the arms of Zeus, since he is our greatest.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.214">She spoke, and from her breasts unbound the elaborate, pattern-pierced</p>
	<p id="IL.14.215">zone, and on it are figured all beguilements, and loveliness</p>
	<p id="IL.14.216">is figured upon it, and passion of sex is there, and the whispered</p>
	<p id="IL.14.217">endearment that steals the heart away even from the thoughtful.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.218">She put this in Hera's hands, and called her by name and spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.219">'Take this zone, and hide it away in the fold of your bosom.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.220">It is elaborate, all things are figured therein. And I think</p>
	<p id="IL.14.221">whatever is your heart's desire shall not go unaccomplished.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.222">So she spoke, and the ox-eyed lady Hera smiled on her</p>
	<p id="IL.14.223">and smiling hid the zone away in the fold of her bosom.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.224">So Aphrodite went back into the house, Zeus' daughter,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.225">while Hera in a flash of speed left the horn of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.14.226">and crossed over Pieria and Emathia the lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.14.227">and overswept the snowy hills of the Thracian riders</p>
	<p id="IL.14.228">and their uttermost pinnacles, nor touched the ground with her feet. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.14.229">from Athos she crossed over the heaving main sea</p>
	<p id="IL.14.230">and came to Lemnos, and to the city of godlike Thoas.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.231">There she encountered Sleep, the brother of Death. She clung</p>
	<p id="IL.14.232">fast to his hand and spoke a word and called him by name: 'Sleep,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.233">lord over all mortal men and all gods, if ever</p>
	<p id="IL.14.234">before now you listened to word of mine, so now also</p>
	<p id="IL.14.235">do as I ask; and all my days I shall know gratitude.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.236">Put to sleep the shining eyes of Zeus under his brows</p>
	<p id="IL.14.237">as soon as I have lain beside him in love. I will give you</p>
	<p id="IL.14.238">gifts; a lovely throne, imperishable forever,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.239">of gold. My own son, he of the strong arms, Hephaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.240">shall make it with careful skill and make for your feet a footstool</p>
	<p id="IL.14.241">on which you can rest your shining feet when you take your pleasure.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.242">Then Sleep the still and soft spoke to her in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.243">'Hera, honoured goddess and daughter of mighty Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.244">any other one of the gods, whose race is immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.245">I would lightly put to sleep, even the stream of that River</p>
	<p id="IL.14.246">Okeanos, whence is risen the seed of all the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.247">But I would not come too close to Zeus, the son of Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.248">nor put him to sleep, unless when he himself were to tell me.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.249">Before now, it was a favour to you that taught me wisdom,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.250">on the day Herakles, the high-hearted son of Zeus, was sailing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.251">from Ilion, when he had utterly sacked the city of the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.252">That time I laid to sleep the brain in Zeus of the aegis</p>
	<p id="IL.14.253">and drifted upon him still and soft, but your mind was devising</p>
	<p id="IL.14.254">evil, and you raised along the sea the blasts of the racking</p>
	<p id="IL.14.255">winds, and on these swept him away to Kos, the strong-founded,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.256">with all his friends lost, but Zeus awakened in anger</p>
	<p id="IL.14.257">and beat the gods up and down his house, looking beyond all others</p>
	<p id="IL.14.258">for me, and would have sunk me out of sight in the sea from the bright sky</p>
	<p id="IL.14.259">had not Night who has power over gods and men rescued me.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.260">I reached her in my flight, and Zeus let be, though he was angry</p>
	<p id="IL.14.261">in awe of doing anything to swift Night's displeasure.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.262">Now you ask me to do this other impossible thing for you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.263">Then in turn the lady ox-eyed Hera answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.264">'Sleep, why do you ponder this in your heart, and hesitate?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.265">Or do you think that Zeus of the wide brows, aiding the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.266">will be angry as he was angry for his son, Herakles?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.267">Come now, do it, and I will give you one of the younger</p>
	<p id="IL.14.268">Graces for you to marry, and she shall be called your lady;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.269">Pasithea, since all your days you have loved her forever.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.270">So she spoke, and Sleep was pleased and spoke to her in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.271">'Come then! Swear it to me on Styx' ineluctable water.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.272">With one hand take hold of the prospering earth, with the other</p>
	<p id="IL.14.273">take hold of the shining salt sea, so that all the undergods</p>
	<p id="IL.14.274">who gather about Kronos may be witnesses to us.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.275">Swear that you will give me one of the younger Graces,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.276">Pasithea, the one whom all my days I have longed for.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.277">He spoke, nor failed to persuade the goddess Hera of the white arms,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.278">and she swore as he commanded, and called by their names on all those</p>
	<p id="IL.14.279">gods who live beneath the Pit, and who are called Titans.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.280">Then when she had sworn this, and made her oath a complete thing,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.281">the two went away from Lemnos, and the city of Imbros,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.282">and mantled themselves in mist, and made their way very lightly</p>
	<p id="IL.14.283">till they came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.284">to Lekton, where first they left the water, and went on</p>
	<p id="IL.14.285">over dry land, and with their feet the top of the forest was shaken.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.286">There Sleep stayed, before the eyes of Zeus could light on him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.287">and went up aloft a towering pine tree, the one that grew tallest</p>
	<p id="IL.14.288">at that time on Ida, and broke through the close air to the aether.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.289">In this he sat, covered over and hidden by the pine branches,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.290">in the likeness of a singing bird whom in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.14.291">the immortal gods call chalkis, but men call him kymindis.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.292">But Hera light-footed made her way to the peak of Gargaros</p>
	<p id="IL.14.293">on towering Ida. And Zeus who gathers the clouds saw her,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.294">and when he saw her desire was a mist about his close heart</p>
	<p id="IL.14.295">as much as on that time they first went to bed together</p>
	<p id="IL.14.296">and lay in love, and their dear parents knew nothing of it.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.297">He stood before her and called her by name and spoke to her: 'Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.298">what is your desire that you come down here from Olympos?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.299">And your horses are not here, nor your chariot, which you would ride in.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.300">Then with false lying purpose the lady Hera answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.301">'I am going to the ends of the generous earth, on a visit</p>
	<p id="IL.14.302">to Okeanos, whence the gods have risen, and Tethys our mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.303">who brought me up kindly in their own house, and cared for me.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.304">I shall go to visit these, and resolve their division of discord,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.305">since now for a long time they have stayed apart from each other</p>
	<p id="IL.14.306">and from the bed of love, since rancour has entered their feelings.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.307">In the foothills by Ida of the waters are standing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.308">my horses, who will carry me over hard land and water.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.309">Only now I have come down here from Olympos for your sake</p>
	<p id="IL.14.310">so you will not be angry with me afterwards, if I</p>
	<p id="IL.14.311">have gone silently to the house of deep-running Okeanos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.312">Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.313">'Hera, there will be a time afterwards when you can go there</p>
	<p id="IL.14.314">as well. But now let us go to bed and turn to love-making.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.315">For never before has love for any goddess or woman</p>
	<p id="IL.14.316">so melted about the heart inside me, broken it to submission,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.317">as now: not that time when I loved the wife of Ixion</p>
	<p id="IL.14.318">who bore me Peirithoös, equal of the gods in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.319">nor when I loved Akrisios' daughter, sweet-stepping Danaë,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.320">who bore Perseus to me, pre-eminent among all men,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.321">nor when I loved the daughter of far-renowned Phoinix, Europa</p>
	<p id="IL.14.322">who bore Minos to me, and Rhadamanthys the godlike;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.323">not when I loved Semele, or Alkmene in Thebe,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.324">when Alkmene bore me a son, Herakles the strong-hearted,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.325">while Semele's son was Dionysos, the pleasure of mortals;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.326">not when I loved the queen Demeter of the lovely tresses,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.327">not when it was glorious Leto, nor yourself, so much</p>
	<p id="IL.14.328">as now I love you, and the sweet passion has taken hold of me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.329">Then with false lying purpose the lady Hera answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.330">'Most honoured son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.331">If now your great desire is to lie in love together</p>
	<p id="IL.14.332">here on the peaks of Ida, everything can be seen. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.14.333">what would happen if some one of the gods everlasting</p>
	<p id="IL.14.334">saw us sleeping, and went and told all the other immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.14.335">of it? I would not simply rise out of bed and go back</p>
	<p id="IL.14.336">again, into your house, and such a thing would be shameful.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.337">No, if this is your heart's desire, if this is your wish, then</p>
	<p id="IL.14.338">there is my chamber, which my beloved son Hephaistos</p>
	<p id="IL.14.339">has built for me, and closed the leaves in the door-posts snugly.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.340">We can go back there and lie down, since bed is your pleasure.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.341">Then in turn Zeus who gathers the clouds answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.342">'Hera, do not fear that any mortal or any god</p>
	<p id="IL.14.343">will see, so close shall be the golden cloud that I gather</p>
	<p id="IL.14.344">about us. Not even Helios can look at us through it,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.345">although beyond all others his light has the sharpest vision.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.346">So speaking, the son of Kronos caught his wife in his arms. There</p>
	<p id="IL.14.347">underneath them the divine earth broke into young, fresh</p>
	<p id="IL.14.348">grass, and into dewy clover, crocus and hyacinth</p>
	<p id="IL.14.349">so thick and soft it held the hard ground deep away from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.350">There they lay down together and drew about them a golden</p>
	<p id="IL.14.351">wonderful cloud, and from it the glimmering dew descended.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.352">So the father slept unshaken on the peak of Gargaron</p>
	<p id="IL.14.353">with his wife in his arms, when sleep and passion had stilled him;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.354">but gently Sleep went on the run to the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.14.355">with a message to tell him who circles the earth and shakes it,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.356">Poseidon, and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.357">'Poseidon, now with all your heart defend the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.14.358">and give them glory, though only for a little, while Zeus still</p>
	<p id="IL.14.359">sleeps; since I have mantled a soft slumber about him</p>
	<p id="IL.14.360">and Hera beguiled him into sleeping in love beside her.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.361">He spoke so, and went away among the famed races</p>
	<p id="IL.14.362">of men, and stirred Poseidon even more to defend the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.363">He sprang among their foremost and urged them on in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.364">'Argives, now once more must we give the best of it to Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.365">Priam's son, so he may take our ships and win glory from them?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.366">Such is his thought and such is his prayer, because now Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.14.367">in the anger of his heart stays still among the hollow ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.368">But there will not be too much longing for him, if the others</p>
	<p id="IL.14.369">of us can stir ourselves up to stand by each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.370">Come; then, do as I say, let us all be won over; let us</p>
	<p id="IL.14.371">take those shields which are best in all the army and biggest</p>
	<p id="IL.14.372">and put them on, and cover our heads in the complete shining</p>
	<p id="IL.14.373">of helmets, and take in our hands our spears that are longest</p>
	<p id="IL.14.374">and go. I myself will lead the way, and I think that no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.14.375">Hektor, Priam's son, can stand up to us, for all his fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.376">Let the man stubborn in battle who wears a small shield on his shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.14.377">give it to a worse man, and put on the shield that is bigger.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.378">So he spoke, and they listened hard to him, and obeyed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.379">The kings in person marshalled these men, although they were wounded,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.380">Tydeus' son, and Odysseus, and Atreus' son Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.381">They went among all, and made them exchange their armour of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.382">and the good fighter put on the good armour, and each gave the worse gear</p>
	<p id="IL.14.383">to the worse. Then when in the shining bronze they had shrouded their bodies</p>
	<p id="IL.14.384">they went forward, and Poseidon the shaker of the earth led them</p>
	<p id="IL.14.385">holding in his heavy hand the stark sword with the thin edge</p>
	<p id="IL.14.386">glittering, as glitters the thunderflash none may close with</p>
	<p id="IL.14.387">by right in sorrowful division, but fear holds all men back.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.388">On the other side glorious Hektor ordered the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.389">and now Poseidon of the dark hair and glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.14.390">strained to its deadliest the division of battle, the one</p>
	<p id="IL.14.391">bringing power to the Trojans, and the god to the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.392">The breaking of the sea washed up to the ships and the shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.14.393">of the Argives. The two sides closed together with a great war cry.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.394">Not such is the roaring against dry land of the sea's surf</p>
	<p id="IL.14.395">as it rolls in from the open under the hard blast of the north wind;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.396">not such is the bellowing of fire in its blazing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.397">in the deep places of the hills when it rises inflaming the forest,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.398">nor such again the crying voice of the wind in the deep-haired</p>
	<p id="IL.14.399">oaks, when it roars highest in its fury against them,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.400">not so loud as now the noise of Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.14.401">in voice of terror rose as they drove against one another.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.402">First glorious Hektor made a cast with his spear at Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.14.403">since he had turned straight against him, nor missed with his throw</p>
	<p id="IL.14.404">but struck, there where over his chest were crossed the two straps,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.405">one for the sword with the silver nails, and one for the great shield.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.406">These guarded the tenderness of his skin. And Hektor, in anger</p>
	<p id="IL.14.407">because his weapon had been loosed from his hand in a vain cast,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.408">to avoid death shrank into the host of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.409">But as he drew away huge Telamonian Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.14.410">caught up a rock; there were many, holding-stones for the fast ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.411">rolled among the feet of the fighters; he caught up one of these</p>
	<p id="IL.14.412">and hit him in the chest next the throat over his shield rim,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.413">and spun him around like a top with the stroke, so that he staggered</p>
	<p id="IL.14.414">in a circle; as a great oak goes down root-torn under</p>
	<p id="IL.14.415">Zeus father's stroke, and a horrible smell of sulphur uprises</p>
	<p id="IL.14.416">from it, and there is no courage left in a man who stands by</p>
	<p id="IL.14.417">and looks on, for the thunderstroke of great Zeus is a hard thing;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.418">so Hektor in all his strength dropped suddenly in the dust, let</p>
	<p id="IL.14.419">fall the spear from his hand, and his shield was beaten upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.420">and the helm, and his armour elaborate with bronze clashed over him.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.421">Screaming aloud the sons of the Achaians ran forward</p>
	<p id="IL.14.422">in hope to drag him away, and threw their volleying javelins</p>
	<p id="IL.14.423">against him, yet no man could stab or cast at the shepherd</p>
	<p id="IL.14.424">of the people; sooner the Trojans' bravest gathered about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.425">Aineias, and Poulydamas, and brilliant Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.426">Sarpedon, lord of the Lykians, and Glaukos the blameless;</p>
	<p id="IL.14.427">and of the rest no man was heedless of him, but rather</p>
	<p id="IL.14.428">sloped the strong circles of their shields over him, while his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.14.429">caught him in their arms out of the fighting and reached his fast-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.14.430">horses, where they stood to the rear of the fighting and the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.14.431">holding their charioteer and the elaborate chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.432">and these carried him, groaning heavily, back toward the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.433">But when they came to the crossing place of the fair-running river,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.434">of whirling Xanthos, whose father was Zeus the immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.435">they moved him from behind his horses to the ground, and splashed</p>
	<p id="IL.14.436">water over him. He got his wind again, and his eyes cleared,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.437">and he got up to lean on one knee and vomit a dark clot</p>
	<p id="IL.14.438">of blood, then lay back on the ground again, while over both eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.14.439">dark night misted. His strength was still broken by the stone's stroke.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.440">But the Argives, when they saw Hektor withdrawing from them,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.441">remembered once again their warcraft and turned on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.442">There far before them all swift Aias son of Oïleus</p>
	<p id="IL.14.443">made an outrush, and stabbed with the sharp spear Satnios,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.444">Enops' son, whom the perfect naiad nymph had borne once</p>
	<p id="IL.14.445">to Enops, as he tended his herds by Satnioeis river.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.446">The spear-famed son of Oïleus, coming close to this man,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.447">stabbed him in the flank so that he knocked him backward, and over him</p>
	<p id="IL.14.448">Trojans and Danaans closed together in strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.449">Poulydamas of the shaken spear came up to stand by him,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.450">Panthoös'son, and struck in the right shoulder Prothoënor</p>
	<p id="IL.14.451">son of Areïlykos, and the powerful spear was driven</p>
	<p id="IL.14.452">through the shoulder, and he dropping in the dust clawed the ground in his fingers.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.453">Poulydamas vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.454">'I think this javelin leaping from the heavy hand of Panthoös'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.455">high-hearted son was not thrown away in a vain cast. Rather</p>
	<p id="IL.14.456">some Argive caught it in his skin. I think he has got it</p>
	<p id="IL.14.457">for a stick to lean on as he trudges down into Death's house.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.458">He spoke, and sorrow came over the Argives at his vaunting,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.459">and beyond others he stirred the anger in wise Telamonian</p>
	<p id="IL.14.460">Aias, for the man had fallen closest to him, and at once</p>
	<p id="IL.14.461">he made a cast with the shining spear at returning Poulydamas.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.462">But Poulydamas himself avoided the dark death</p>
	<p id="IL.14.463">with a quick spring to one side, and Archelochos son of Antenor</p>
	<p id="IL.14.464">caught the spear, since the immortal gods had doomed his destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.465">He hit him at the joining place of head and neck, at the last</p>
	<p id="IL.14.466">vertebra, and cut through both of the tendons, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.14.467">the man's head and mouth and nose hit the ground far sooner</p>
	<p id="IL.14.468">than did the front of his legs and knees as he fell. And Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.14.469">spoke aloud in answer to unfaulted Poulydamas:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.470">'Think over this, Poulydamas, and answer me truly.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.471">Is not this man's death against Prothoënor's a worthwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.14.472">exchange? I think he is no mean man, nor born of mean fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.473">but is some brother of Antenor, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.474">or his son; since he is close in blood by the look of him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.475">He spoke, knowing well what he said, and sorrow fastened on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.476">There Akamas, bestriding his brother, stabbed the Boiotian</p>
	<p id="IL.14.477">Promachos with the spear as he tried to drag off the body.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.478">Akamas vaunted terribly over him, calling in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.479">'You Argives, arrow-fighters, insatiate of menace. I think</p>
	<p id="IL.14.480">we shall not be the only ones to be given hard work</p>
	<p id="IL.14.481">and sorrow, but you too must sometimes die, as this man did.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.482">Think how Promachos sleeps among you, beaten down under</p>
	<p id="IL.14.483">my spear, so that punishment for my brother may not go</p>
	<p id="IL.14.484">long unpaid. Therefore a man prays he will leave behind him</p>
	<p id="IL.14.485">one close to him in his halls to avenge his downfall in battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.486">He spoke, and sorrow came over the Argives at his vaunting,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.487">and beyond others he stirred the anger in wise Peneleos.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.488">He charged Akamas, who would not stand up against the onset</p>
	<p id="IL.14.489">of lord Peneleos. He then stabbed with the spear Ilioneus</p>
	<p id="IL.14.490">the son of Phorbas the rich in sheepflocks, whom beyond all men</p>
	<p id="IL.14.491">of the Trojans Hermes loved, and gave him possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.492">Ilioneus was the only child his mother had borne him.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.493">This man Peneleos caught underneath the brow, at the bases</p>
	<p id="IL.14.494">of the eye, and pushed the eyeball out, and the spear went clean through</p>
	<p id="IL.14.495">the eye-socket and tendon of the neck, so that he went down</p>
	<p id="IL.14.496">backward, reaching out both hands, but Peneleos drawing</p>
	<p id="IL.14.497">his sharp sword hewed at the neck in the middle, and so dashed downward</p>
	<p id="IL.14.498">the head, with helm upon it, while still on the point of the big spear</p>
	<p id="IL.14.499">the eyeball stuck. He, lifting it high like the head of a poppy,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.500">displayed it to the Trojans and spoke vaunting over it:</p>
	<p id="IL.14.501">'Trojans, tell haughty Ilioneus' beloved father</p>
	<p id="IL.14.502">and mother, from me, that they can weep for him in their halls, since</p>
	<p id="IL.14.503">neither shall the wife of Promachos, Alegenor's</p>
	<p id="IL.14.504">son, take pride of delight in her dear lord's coming, on that day</p>
	<p id="IL.14.505">when we sons of the Achaians come home from Troy in our vessels.'</p>
	<p id="IL.14.506">So he spoke, and the shivers came over the limbs of all of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.507">and each man looked about him for a way to escape the sheer death.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.508">Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.509">who was first of the Achaians to win the bloody despoilment</p>
	<p id="IL.14.510">of men, when the glorious shaker of the earth bent the way of the battle?</p>
	<p id="IL.14.511">First Telamonian Aias cut down Hyrtios, he who</p>
	<p id="IL.14.512">was son to Gyrtios, and lord over the strong-hearted Mysians.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.513">Antilochos slaughtered Phalkes and Mermeros. Morys</p>
	<p id="IL.14.514">and Hippotion were killed by Meriones. Teukros cut down</p>
	<p id="IL.14.515">Periphetes and Prothoön. Next the son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.516">Menelaos, stabbed Hyperenor, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.517">in the flank, so the bronze head let gush out the entrails</p>
	<p id="IL.14.518">through the torn side. His life came out through the wound of the spearstab</p>
	<p id="IL.14.519">in beating haste, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.14.520">But Aias the fast-footed son of Oïleus caught and killed most,</p>
	<p id="IL.14.521">since there was none like him in the speed of his feet to go after</p>
	<p id="IL.14.522">men who ran, once Zeus had driven the terror upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.1">But after they had crossed back over the ditch and the sharp stakes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.2">in flight, and many had gone down under the hands of the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.3">they checked about once more and stood their ground by the chariots,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.4">green for fear and terrified. But now Zeus wakened</p>
	<p id="IL.15.5">by Hera of the gold throne on the high places of Ida,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.6">and stood suddenly upright, and saw the Achaians and Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.7">these driven to flight, the others harrying them in confusion,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.8">these last Argives, and saw among them the lord Poseidon.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.9">He saw Hektor lying in the plain, his companions sitting</p>
	<p id="IL.15.10">around him, he dazed at the heart and breathing painfully,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.11">vomiting blood, since not the weakest Achaian had hit him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.12">Then the father of gods and men seeing Hektor pitied him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.13">and looked scowling terribly at Hera, and spoke a word to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.14">'Hopeless one, it was your evil design, your treachery, Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.15">that stayed brilliant Hektor from battle, terrified his people.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.16">I do not know, perhaps for this contrivance of evil</p>
	<p id="IL.15.17">and pain you will win first reward when I lash you with whip strokes.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.18">Do you not remember that time you hung from high and on your feet</p>
	<p id="IL.15.19">I slung two anvils, and about your hands drove a golden</p>
	<p id="IL.15.20">chain, unbreakable. You among the clouds and the bright sky</p>
	<p id="IL.15.21">hung, nor could the gods about tall Olympos endure it</p>
	<p id="IL.15.22">and stood about, but could not set you free. If I caught one</p>
	<p id="IL.15.23">I would seize and throw him from the threshold, until he landed</p>
	<p id="IL.15.24">stunned on the earth, yet even so the weariless agony</p>
	<p id="IL.15.25">for Herakles the godlike would not let go my spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.26">You with the north wind's aid winning over the stormwinds drove him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.27">on across the desolate sea in evil intention</p>
	<p id="IL.15.28">and then on these swept him away to Kos, the strong-founded.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.29">I myself rescued him there and brought him back once more</p>
	<p id="IL.15.30">to horse-pasturing Argos, when he had been through much hardship.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.31">I will remind you of all this, so you will give up</p>
	<p id="IL.15.32">your deceptions, see if your love-making in bed will help you,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.33">that way you lay with me apart from the gods, and deceived me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.34">He spoke, and the lady the ox-eyed goddess Hera was frightened</p>
	<p id="IL.15.35">and she spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: 'Now let</p>
	<p id="IL.15.36">Earth be my witness in this, and the wide heaven above us,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.37">and the dripping water of the Styx, which oath is the biggest</p>
	<p id="IL.15.38">and most formidable oath among the blessed immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.39">The sanctity of your head be witness, and the bed of marriage</p>
	<p id="IL.15.40">between us: a thing by which I at least could never swear vainly.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.41">It is not through my will that the shaker of the earth Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.15.42">afflicts the Trojans and Hektor and gives aid to the others,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.43">but it is his own passion that urges him to it and drives him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.44">He saw the Achaians hard pressed beside their ships, and pitied them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.45">No, but I myself also would give him counsel</p>
	<p id="IL.15.46">to go with you, o dark clouded, that way that you lead us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.47">She spoke, and now the father of gods and men smiled on her</p>
	<p id="IL.15.48">and spoke again in answer to her, and addressed her in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.49">'If even you, lady Hera of the ox eyes, hereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.15.50">were to take your place among the immortals thinking as I do,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.51">then Poseidon, hard though he may wish it otherwise,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.52">must at once turn his mind so it follows your heart, and my heart.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.53">If now all this that you say is real, and you speak truthfully,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.54">go now among the generations of the gods, and summon</p>
	<p id="IL.15.55">Iris to come here to me, and Apollo the glorious archer,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.56">so that Iris may go among the bronze-armoured people</p>
	<p id="IL.15.57">of the Achaians, and give a message to lord Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.15.58">to leave the fighting and come back to the home that is his. Also</p>
	<p id="IL.15.59">let Phoibos Apollo stir Hektor back into battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.60">breathe strength into him once more, and make him forget the agonies</p>
	<p id="IL.15.61">that now are wearing out his senses. Let him drive strengthless</p>
	<p id="IL.15.62">panic into the Achaians, and turn them back once more;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.63">let them be driven in flight and tumble back on the benched ships</p>
	<p id="IL.15.64">of Achilleus, Peleus' son. And he shall rouse up Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.15.65">his companion. And glorious Hektor shall cut down Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.15.66">with the spear before Ilion, after he has killed many others</p>
	<p id="IL.15.67">of the young men, and among them my own son, shining Sarpedon.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.68">In anger for him brilliant Achilleus shall then kill Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.69">And from then on I would make the fighting surge back from the vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.15.70">always and continuously, until the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.71">capture headlong Ilion through the designs of Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.72">Before this I am not stopping my anger, and I will not let</p>
	<p id="IL.15.73">any other of the immortals stand there by the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.74">until the thing asked by the son of Peleus has been accomplished</p>
	<p id="IL.15.75">as I undertook at the first and bent my head in assent to it</p>
	<p id="IL.15.76">on that day when embracing my knees immortal Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.15.77">supplicated honour for Achilleus, sacker of cities.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.78">He spoke, and the goddess of the white arms Hera did not disobey him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.79">but went back to tall Olympos from the mountains of Ida.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.80">As the thought flashes in the mind of a man who, traversing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.81">much territory, thinks of things in the mind's awareness,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.82">'I wish I were this place, or this', and imagines many things;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.83">so rapidly in her eagerness winged Hera, a goddess.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.84">She came to sheer Olympos and entered among the assembled</p>
	<p id="IL.15.85">immortal gods in the house of Zeus, and they seeing her</p>
	<p id="IL.15.86">rose all to swarm about her and lifted their cups in greeting.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.87">But Hera passed by the others and accepted a cup from Themis</p>
	<p id="IL.15.88">of the fair cheeks, since she had first come running to greet her</p>
	<p id="IL.15.89">and had spoken to her and addressed her in winged words: 'Hera,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.90">why have you come? You seem like one who has been terrified.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.91">I know, it was the son of Kronos, your husband, frightened you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.92">In turn the goddess Hera of the white arms answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.93">'Ask me nothing of this, divine Themis. You yourself</p>
	<p id="IL.15.94">know what his spirit is, how it is stubborn and arrogant.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.95">Preside still over the gods in their house, the feast's fair division.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.96">Yet so much may you hear, and with you all the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.97">how Zeus discloses evil actions, and I do not think</p>
	<p id="IL.15.98">the heart of all will be pleasured alike, neither among mortals</p>
	<p id="IL.15.99">nor gods either, although one now still feasts at his pleasure.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.100">The lady Hera spoke so and sat down, and the gods</p>
	<p id="IL.15.101">about the house of Zeus were troubled. Hera was smiling</p>
	<p id="IL.15.102">with her lips, but above the dark brows her forehead</p>
	<p id="IL.15.103">was not at peace. She spoke before them all in vexation:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.104">'Fools, we who try to work against Zeus, thoughtlessly.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.105">Still we are thinking in our anger to go near, and stop him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.106">by argument or force. He sits apart and cares nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.107">nor thinks of us, and says that among the other immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.15.108">he is pre-eminently the greatest in power and strength. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.15.109">each of you must take whatever evil he sends you.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.110">Since I think already a sorrow has been wrought against Ares.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.111">His son has been killed in the fighting, dearest of all men</p>
	<p id="IL.15.112">to him, Askalaphos, whom stark Ares calls his own son.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.113">So she spoke. Then Ares struck against both his big thighs</p>
	<p id="IL.15.114">with the flats of his hands, and spoke a word of anger and sorrow:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.115">'Now, you who have your homes on Olympos, you must not blame me</p>
	<p id="IL.15.116">for going among the ships of the Achaians, and avenging my son's</p>
	<p id="IL.15.117">slaughter, even though it be my fate to be struck by Zeus'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.118">thunderbolt, and sprawl in the blood and dust by the dead men.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.119">So he spoke, and ordered Fear and Terror to harness</p>
	<p id="IL.15.120">his horses, and himself got into his shining armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.121">And there might have been wrought another anger, and bitterness</p>
	<p id="IL.15.122">from Zeus, still greater, more wearisome among the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.123">had not Athene, in her fear for the sake of all gods,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.124">sprung up and out through the forecourt, left her chair where she was sitting,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.125">and taken the helmet off from his head, the shield from his shoulders,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.126">and snatched out of his heavy hand the bronze spear, and fixed it</p>
	<p id="IL.15.127">apart, and then in speech reasoned with violent Ares:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.128">'Madman, mazed of your wits, this is ruin! Your ears can listen</p>
	<p id="IL.15.129">still to reality, but your mind is gone and your discipline.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.130">Do you not hear what the goddess Hera of the white arms tells us,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.131">and she coming back even now from Zeus of Olympos?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.132">Do you wish, after running the course of many misfortunes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.133">yourself, still to come back to Olympos under compulsion</p>
	<p id="IL.15.134">though reluctant, and plant seed of great sorrow among the rest of us?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.135">Since he will at once leave the Achaians and the high-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.15.136">Trojans, and come back to batter us on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.15.137">and will catch up as they come the guilty one and the guiltless.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.138">Therefore I ask of you to give up your anger for your son.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.139">By now some other, better of his strength and hands than your son was,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.140">has been killed, or will soon be killed; and it is a hard thing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.141">to rescue all the generation and seed of all mortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.142">So she spoke, and seated on a chair violent Ares.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.143">But Hera called to come with her outside the house Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.15.144">and Iris, who is messenger among the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.15.145">gods, and spoke to them and addressed them in winged words: 'Zeus wishes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.146">both of you to go to him with all speed, at Ida;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.147">but when you have come there and looked upon Zeus' countenance,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.148">then you must do whatever he urges you, and his orders.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.149">So the lady Hera spoke, and once more returning</p>
	<p id="IL.15.150">sat on her throne. They in a flash of speed winged their way onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.151">They came to Ida with all her springs, the mother of wild beasts,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.152">and found the wide-browed son of Kronos on the height of Gargaron,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.153">sitting still, and fragrant cloud gathered in a circle about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.154">These two came into the presence of Zeus the cloud-gatherer</p>
	<p id="IL.15.155">and stood, nor was his heart angry when he looked upon them,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.156">seeing they had promptly obeyed the message of his dear lady.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.157">He spoke to Iris first of the two, and addressed her in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.158">'Go on your way now, swift Iris, to the lord Poseidon,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.159">and give him all this message nor be a false messenger. Tell him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.160">that he must now quit the war and the fighting, and go back</p>
	<p id="IL.15.161">among the generations of gods, or into the bright sea.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.162">And if he will not obey my words, or thinks nothing of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.163">then let him consider in his heart and his spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.15.164">that he might not, strong though he is, be able to stand up</p>
	<p id="IL.15.165">to my attack; since I say I am far greater than he is</p>
	<p id="IL.15.166">in strength, and elder born; yet his inward heart shrinks not from calling</p>
	<p id="IL.15.167">himself the equal of me, though others shudder before me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.168">He spoke, and swift wind-footed Iris did not disobey him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.169">but went down along the hills of Ida to sacred Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.170">As those times when out of the clouds the snow or the hail whirls</p>
	<p id="IL.15.171">cold beneath the blast of the north wind born in the bright air,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.172">so rapidly in her eagerness winged Iris, the swift one,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.173">and stood beside the famed shaker of the earth, and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.174">'I have a certain message for you, dark-haired, earth-encircler,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.175">and came here to bring it to you from Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.176">His order is that you quit the war and the fighting, and go back</p>
	<p id="IL.15.177">among the generations of gods, or into the bright sea.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.178">And if you will not obey his words, or think nothing of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.179">his threat is that he himself will come to fight with you</p>
	<p id="IL.15.180">here, strength against strength, but warns you to keep from under</p>
	<p id="IL.15.181">his hands, since he says he is far greater than you are</p>
	<p id="IL.15.182">in strength, and elder born. Yet your inward heart shrinks not from calling</p>
	<p id="IL.15.183">yourself the equal of him, though others shudder before him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.184">Then deeply vexed the famed shaker of the earth spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.185">'No, no. Great though he is, this that he has said is too much,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.186">if he will force me against my will, me, who am his equal</p>
	<p id="IL.15.187">in rank. Since we are three brothers born by Rheia to Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.188">Zeus, and I, and the third is Hades, lord of the dead men.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.189">All was divided among us three ways, each given his domain.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.190">I when the lots were shaken drew the grey sea to live in</p>
	<p id="IL.15.191">forever; Hades drew the lot of the mists and the darkness,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.192">and Zeus was allotted the wide sky, in the cloud and the bright air.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.193">But earth and high Olympos are common to all three. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.15.194">I am no part of the mind of Zeus. Let him in tranquillity</p>
	<p id="IL.15.195">and powerful as he is stay satisfied with his third share.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.196">And let him absolutely stop frightening me, as if I were</p>
	<p id="IL.15.197">mean, with his hands. It were better to keep for the sons and the daughters</p>
	<p id="IL.15.198">he got himself these blusterings and these threats of terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.199">They will listen, because they must, to whatever he tells them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.200">Then in turn swift wind-footed Iris answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.201">'Am I then to carry, o dark-haired, earth-encircler,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.202">this word, which is strong and steep, back to Zeus from you?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.203">Or will you change a little? The hearts of the great can be changed.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.204">You know the Furies, how they forever side with the elder.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.205">Then in turn the shaker of the earth Poseidon spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.206">'Now this, divine Iris, was a word quite properly spoken.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.207">It is a fine thing when a messenger is conscious of justice.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.208">But this thing comes as a bitter sorrow to my heart and my spirit,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.209">when Zeus tries in words of anger to reprimand one who</p>
	<p id="IL.15.210">is his equal in station, and endowed with destiny like his.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.211">Still, this time I will give way, for all my vexation.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.212">But I will say this also, and make it a threat in my anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.213">If ever, acting apart from me and Athene the spoiler,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.214">apart from Hera and Hermes and the lord Hephaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.215">he shall spare headlong Ilion, and shall not be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.216">to take it by storm, and bestow great victory on the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.217">let him be sure, there will be no more healing of our anger.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.218">The shaker of the earth spoke, and left the Achaian people,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.219">and went, merging in the sea, and the fighting Achaians longed for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.220">After this Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to Apollo:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.221">'Go now, beloved Phoibos, to the side of brazen-helmed Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.222">since by this he who encircles the earth and shakes it</p>
	<p id="IL.15.223">is gone into the bright sea and has avoided the anger</p>
	<p id="IL.15.224">that would be ours. In truth, this would have been a fight those other</p>
	<p id="IL.15.225">gods would have heard about, who gather to Kronos beneath us.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.226">Now this way it was far better for me, and for himself</p>
	<p id="IL.15.227">also, that, for all his vexation before, he gave way</p>
	<p id="IL.15.228">to my hands. We would have sweated before this business was finished.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.229">Now yourself take up in your hands the aegis with fluttering</p>
	<p id="IL.15.230">tassels, and shake it hard to scare the Achaian fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.231">Then, striker from afar, let your own concern be glorious Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.232">So long waken the huge strength in him, until the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.233">run in flight, and come to the ships and the crossing of Helle.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.234">From there on I myself shall think of the word and the action</p>
	<p id="IL.15.235">to make the Achaians get wind once more, after their hard fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.236">He spoke so, and Apollo, not disregarding his father,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.237">came down along the mountains of Ida in the likeness of a rapid</p>
	<p id="IL.15.238">hawk, the dove's murderer and swiftest of all things flying.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.239">He found brilliant Hektor, the son of wise Priam, sitting</p>
	<p id="IL.15.240">now, no longer sprawled, as he gathered new strength back into him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.241">and recognized his companions about him. The sweat and hard breathing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.242">had begun to stop, once the will in Zeus of the aegis wakened him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.243">Apollo who works from afar stood beside him, and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.244">'Hektor, son of Priam, why do you sit in such weakness</p>
	<p id="IL.15.245">here apart from the others? Did some disaster befall you?'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.246">In his weakness Hektor of the shining helm spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.247">'Who are you, who speak to me face to face, o noblest</p>
	<p id="IL.15.248">of gods? Did you not know how by the Achaians' grounded</p>
	<p id="IL.15.249">ships, Aias of the great war cry struck me in the chest with a boulder</p>
	<p id="IL.15.250">as I slaughtered his companions, and stayed my furious valour?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.251">Truly, I thought that on this day I would come to the corpses</p>
	<p id="IL.15.252">and the house of the death god, once I had breathed the inward life from me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.253">In turn the lord, the worker from afar, Apollo, spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.254">'Take heart; such an avenger am I whom the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.15.255">sent down from Ida, to stand by your side and defend you,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.256">Phoibos Apollo of the golden sword, who in time before this</p>
	<p id="IL.15.257">also have stood to defend yourself and your sheer citadel.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.258">So come now, and urge on your cavalry in their numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.15.259">to drive on their horses against the hollow ships. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.15.260">I shall move on before you and make all the way for the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.15.261">smooth before them, and bend back the Achaian fighters.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.262">He spoke, and breathed huge strength into the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.263">As when some stalled horse who has been corn-fed at the manger</p>
	<p id="IL.15.264">breaking free of his rope gallops over the plain in thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.15.265">to his accustomed bathing place in a sweet-running river</p>
	<p id="IL.15.266">and in the pride of his strength holds high his head and the mane floats</p>
	<p id="IL.15.267">over his shoulders; sure of his glorious strength, the quick knees</p>
	<p id="IL.15.268">carry him to the loved places and the pasture of horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.269">so Hektor moving rapidly his feet and his knees went</p>
	<p id="IL.15.270">onward, stirring the horsemen when he heard the god's voice speak.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.271">And as when men who live in the wilds and their dogs have driven</p>
	<p id="IL.15.272">into flight a horned stag or a wild goat. Inaccessible</p>
	<p id="IL.15.273">the rocky cliff or the shadowed forest has covered the quarry</p>
	<p id="IL.15.274">so that the men know it was not their fortune to take him;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.275">and now by their clamouring shows in the way a great bearded</p>
	<p id="IL.15.276">lion, and bends them to sudden flight for all their eagerness;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.277">so the Danaans until that time kept always in close chase</p>
	<p id="IL.15.278">assembled, stabbing at them with swords and leaf-headed spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.279">but when they saw Hektor once more ranging the men's ranks</p>
	<p id="IL.15.280">they were frightened, and by their feet collapsed all their bravery.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.281">Now Thoas spoke forth among them, the son of Andraimon,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.282">far the best of the Aitolians, one skilled in the spear's throw</p>
	<p id="IL.15.283">and brave in close fight. In assembly few of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.284">when the young men contended in debate could outdo him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.285">He in kind intention now spoke forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.286">'Can this be? Here is a strange thing I see with my own eyes,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.287">how this Hektor has got to his feet once more, and eluded</p>
	<p id="IL.15.288">the death spirits. I think in each of us the heart had high hope</p>
	<p id="IL.15.289">he was killed under the hands of Telamonian Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.290">Now some one of the gods has come to his help and rescued</p>
	<p id="IL.15.291">Hektor, who has unstrung the knees of so many Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.292">I think he will do it once more now. It is not without Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.15.293">the deep-thundering that he stands their champion in all this fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.294">Come then, let us do as I say, let us all be persuaded.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.295">Let us tell the multitude to make its way back toward the vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.15.296">while we ourselves, who claim we are greatest in all the army,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.297">stand, and see if we can face him first, and hold him off from them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.298">with spears lifted against him, and I think for all of his fury</p>
	<p id="IL.15.299">his heart will be afraid to plunge into our Danaan company.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.300">So he spoke, and they listened to him with care, and obeyed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.301">They who rallied about Aias, the lord Idomeneus,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.302">Teukros, Meriones, and Meges, a man like the war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.303">closed their order for hard impact, calling on the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.15.304">to face Hektor and the Trojans. Meanwhile behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.305">the multitude made their way back toward the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.306">The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.307">in long strides, and in front of him went Phoibos Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.15.308">wearing a mist about his shoulders, and held the tempestuous</p>
	<p id="IL.15.309">terrible aegis, shaggy, conspicuous, that the bronze-smith</p>
	<p id="IL.15.310">Hephaistos had given Zeus to wear to the terror of mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.311">Gripping this in both hands he led on the Trojan people.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.312">But the Argives stood in close order against them, and the battle cry rose up</p>
	<p id="IL.15.313">in a thin scream from either side, the arrows from the bowstrings</p>
	<p id="IL.15.314">jumping, while from violent hands the numerous thrown spears</p>
	<p id="IL.15.315">were driven, some deep in the bodies of quick-stirring young men,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.316">while many in the space between before they had got to the white skin</p>
	<p id="IL.15.317">stood fast in the ground, though they had been straining to reach the bodies.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.318">So long as Phoibos Apollo held stilled in his hands the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.319">so long the thrown weapons of both took hold, and men dropped under them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.320">But when he stared straight into the eyes of the fast-mounted Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.321">and shook the aegis, and himself gave a great baying cry, the spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.15.322">inside them was mazed to hear it, they forgot their furious valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.323">And they, as when in the dim of the black night two wild beasts</p>
	<p id="IL.15.324">stampede a herd of cattle or big flock of sheep, falling</p>
	<p id="IL.15.325">suddenly upon them, when no herdsman is by, the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.326">fled so in their weakness and terror, since Apollo drove</p>
	<p id="IL.15.327">terror upon them, and gave the glory to the Trojans and Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.328">There man killed man all along the scattered encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.329">Hektor first killed Stichios and Arkesilaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.330">one the leader of the bronze-armoured Boiotians, the other</p>
	<p id="IL.15.331">trusted companion in arms of great-hearted Menestheus.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.332">But Aineias slaughtered Medon and Iasos. Of these</p>
	<p id="IL.15.333">Medon was a bastard son of godlike Oïleus</p>
	<p id="IL.15.334">and therefore brother of Aias, but had made his home in Phylake</p>
	<p id="IL.15.335">away from the land of his fathers, having killed a man, a relation</p>
	<p id="IL.15.336">of Eriopis, his stepmother, the wife of Oileus.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.337">Iasos was a leader appointed of the Athenians,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.338">and was called the son of Sphelos, the son of Boukolos.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.339">Poulydamas killed Mekisteus, and Polites Echios</p>
	<p id="IL.15.340">in the first onfall, and brilliant Agenor cut down Klonios.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.341">Paris struck Deïochos from behind at the shoulder's</p>
	<p id="IL.15.342">base, as he ran away through the front ranks, and drove the bronze clean through.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.343">While these stripped the armour from their men, meanwhile the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.344">blundering about the deep-dug ditch and the sharp stakes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.345">ran this way and that in terror, forced into their rampart.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.346">But Hektor called aloud in a piercing cry to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.347">'Make hard for the ships, let the bloody spoils be. That man</p>
	<p id="IL.15.348">I see in the other direction apart from the vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.349">I will take care that he gets his death, and that man's relations</p>
	<p id="IL.15.350">neither men nor women shall give his dead body the rite of burning.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.351">In the space before our city the dogs shall tear him to pieces.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.352">So speaking with a whipstroke from the shoulder he lashed on his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.15.353">calling across the ranks to the Trojans, who along with him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.354">all cried aloud as they steered the horses who pulled their chariots,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.355">with inhuman clamour, and in front of them Phoibos Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.15.356">easily, kicking them with his feet, tumbled the banked edges</p>
	<p id="IL.15.357">of the deep ditch into the pit between, and bridged over a pathway</p>
	<p id="IL.15.358">both wide and long, about as long as the force of a spearcast</p>
	<p id="IL.15.359">goes when a man has thrown it to try his strength. They streamed over</p>
	<p id="IL.15.360">in massed formation, with Apollo in front of them holding</p>
	<p id="IL.15.361">the tremendous aegis, and wrecked the bastions of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.362">easily, as when a little boy piles sand by the sea-shore</p>
	<p id="IL.15.363">when in his innocent play he makes sand towers to amuse him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.364">and then, still playing, with hands and feet ruins them and wrecks them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.365">So you, lord Apollo, piled in confusion much hard work</p>
	<p id="IL.15.366">and painful done by the Argives and drove terror among them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.367">So they reined in and stood fast again beside their ships, calling</p>
	<p id="IL.15.368">aloud upon each other, and to all of the gods, uplifting</p>
	<p id="IL.15.369">their hands each man of them cried out his prayers in a great voice,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.370">and beyond others Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians' watcher,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.371">prayed, reaching out both arms to the starry heavens:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.372">'Father Zeus, if ever in wheat-deep Argos one of us</p>
	<p id="IL.15.373">burning before you the rich thigh pieces of sheep or ox prayed</p>
	<p id="IL.15.374">he would come home again, and you nodded your head and assented,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.375">remember this, Olympian, save us from the day without pity;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.376">let not the Achaians be beaten down like this by the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.377">So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels thundered</p>
	<p id="IL.15.378">a great stroke, hearing the prayer of the old man, the son of Neleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.379">But the Trojans, hearing the thunderstroke of Zeus of the aegis,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.380">remembered even more their warcraft, and sprang on the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.381">They, as when the big waves on the sea wide-wandering</p>
	<p id="IL.15.382">wash across the walls of a ship underneath the leaning</p>
	<p id="IL.15.383">force of the wind, which particularly piles up the big waves,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.384">so the Trojans with huge clamour went over the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.15.385">and drove their horses to fight alongside the grounded vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.386">with leaf-headed spears, some at close quarters, others from their horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.387">But the Achaians climbing high on their black ships fought from them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.388">with long pikes that lay among the hulls for sea fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.389">shrouded about the heads in bronze that was soldered upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.390">Meanwhile Patroklos, all the time the Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.391">were fighting on both sides of the wall, far away from the fast ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.392">had sat all this time in the shelter of courtly Eurypylos</p>
	<p id="IL.15.393">and had been entertaining him with words and applying</p>
	<p id="IL.15.394">medicines that would mitigate the black pains to the sore wound.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.395">But when he saw the Trojans were sweeping over the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.15.396">and the outcry and the noise of terror rose from the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.397">Patroklos groaned aloud then and struck himself on both thighs</p>
	<p id="IL.15.398">with the flats of his hands and spoke a word of lamentation:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.399">'Eurypylos, much though you need me I cannot stay here</p>
	<p id="IL.15.400">longer with you. This is a big fight that has arisen.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.401">Now it is for your henchman to look after you, while I</p>
	<p id="IL.15.402">go in haste to Achilleus, to stir him into the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.403">Who knows if, with God helping, I might trouble his spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.15.404">by entreaty, since the persuasion of a friend is a strong thing.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.405">As he was speaking his feet carried him away. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.15.406">the Achaians stood steady against the Trojan attack, but they could not</p>
	<p id="IL.15.407">beat the enemy, fewer as they were, away from their vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.408">nor again had the Trojans strength to break the battalions</p>
	<p id="IL.15.409">of the Danaans, and force their way into the ships and the shelters.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.410">But as a chalkline straightens the cutting of a ship's timber</p>
	<p id="IL.15.411">in the hands of an expert carpenter, who by Athene's</p>
	<p id="IL.15.412">inspiration is well versed in all his craft's subtlety,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.413">so the battles fought by both sides were pulled fast and even.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.414">Now by the ships others fought in their various places</p>
	<p id="IL.15.415">but Hektor made straight for glorious Aias. These two</p>
	<p id="IL.15.416">were fighting hard for a single ship, and neither was able,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.417">Hektor to drive Aias off the ship, and set fire to it,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.418">nor Aias to beat Hektor back, since the divinity</p>
	<p id="IL.15.419">drove him. Shining Aias struck with the spear Kaletor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.420">Klytios' son, in the chest as he brought fire to the vessel.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.421">He fell, thunderously, and the torch dropped from his hand. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.15.422">Hektor, when his eyes were aware of his cousin fallen</p>
	<p id="IL.15.423">in the dust in front of the black ship, uplifting</p>
	<p id="IL.15.424">his voice in a great cry called to the Trojans and Lykians:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.425">'Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.426">do not anywhere in this narrow place give way from the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.15.427">but stand by the son of Klytios, do not let the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.428">strip the armour from him, fallen where the ships are assembled.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.429">So he spoke, and made a cast at Aias with the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.15.430">spear, but missed him and struck the son of Mastor, Lykophron,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.431">henchman of Aias from Kythera who had been living</p>
	<p id="IL.15.432">with him; for he had killed a man in sacred Kythera.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.433">Hektor struck him in the head above the ear with the sharp bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.15.434">as he stood next to Aias, so that Lykophron sprawling</p>
	<p id="IL.15.435">dropped from the ship's stern to the ground, and his strength was broken.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.436">And Aias shuddered at the sight, and spoke to his brother:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.437">'See, dear Teukros, our true companion, the son of Mastor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.438">is killed, who came to us from Kythera and in our household</p>
	<p id="IL.15.439">was one we honoured as we honoured our beloved parents.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.440">Now great-hearted Hektor has killed him. Where are your arrows</p>
	<p id="IL.15.441">of sudden death, and the bow that Phoibos Apollo gave you?'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.442">He spoke, and Teukros heard and came running to stand beside him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.443">holding in his hand the backstrung bow and the quiver</p>
	<p id="IL.15.444">to hold arrows, and let go his hard shots against the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.445">First he struck down Kleitos, the glorious son of Peisenor</p>
	<p id="IL.15.446">and companion of Poulydamas, proud son of Panthoös.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.447">Now Kleitos held the reins, and gave all his care to the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.448">driving them into that place where the most battalions were shaken,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.449">for the favour of Hektor and the Trojans, but the sudden evil</p>
	<p id="IL.15.450">came to him, and none for all their desire could defend him,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.451">for the painful arrow was driven into his neck from behind him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.452">He fell out of the chariot, and the fast-footed horses</p>
	<p id="IL.15.453">shied away, rattling the empty car; but Poulydamas</p>
	<p id="IL.15.454">their master saw it at once, and ran first to the heads of the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.455">He gave them into the hands of Astynoös, Protiaon's</p>
	<p id="IL.15.456">son, with many orders to be watchful and hold the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.15.457">close; then himself went back into the ranks of the champions.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.458">But Teukros picked up another arrow for bronze-helmed</p>
	<p id="IL.15.459">Hektor, and would have stopped his fighting by the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.460">had he hit him during his bravery and torn the life from him;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.461">but he was not hidden from the close purpose of Zeus, who was guarding</p>
	<p id="IL.15.462">Hektor, and denied that glory to Telamonian Teukros;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.463">who broke in the unfaulted bow the close-twisted sinew</p>
	<p id="IL.15.464">as Teukros drew it against him, so the bronze-weighted arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.15.465">went, as the bow dropped out of his hands, driven crazily sidewise.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.466">And Teukros shuddered at the sight, and spoke to his brother:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.467">'See now, how hard the divinity cuts across the intention</p>
	<p id="IL.15.468">in all our battle, who struck the bow out of my hand, who has broken</p>
	<p id="IL.15.469">the fresh-twisted sinew of the bowstring I bound on</p>
	<p id="IL.15.470">this morning, so it would stand the succession of springing arrows.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.471">Then in turn huge Telamonian Aias answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.472">'Dear brother, then let your bow and your showering arrows</p>
	<p id="IL.15.473">lie, now that the god begrudging the Danaans wrecked them.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.474">But take a long spear in your hands, a shield on your shoulder,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.475">and close with the Trojans, and drive on the rest of your people.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.476">Let them not, though they have beaten us, easily capture</p>
	<p id="IL.15.477">our strong-benched ships. We must remember the frenzy of fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.478">He spoke, and Teukros put away the bow in his shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.15.479">and threw across his shoulders the shield of the fourfold ox-hide.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.480">Over his mighty head he set the well-fashioned helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.15.481">with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.482">Then he caught up a powerful spear, edged with sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.483">and went on his way, running fast, and stood beside Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.484">But Hektor, when he saw how the arrows of Teukros were baffled,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.485">lifted his voice in a great cry to the Trojans and Lykians:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.486">'Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.487">be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour</p>
	<p id="IL.15.488">along the hollow ships, since I have seen with my own eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.489">how by the hand of Zeus their bravest man's arrows were baffled.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.490">Easily seen is the strength that is given from Zeus to mortals</p>
	<p id="IL.15.491">either in those into whose hands he gives the surpassing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.492">glory, or those he diminishes and will not defend them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.493">as now he diminishes the strength of the Argives, and helps us.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.494">Fight on then by the ships together. He who among you</p>
	<p id="IL.15.495">finds by spear thrown or spear thrust his death and destiny,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.496">let him die. He has no dishonour when he dies defending</p>
	<p id="IL.15.497">his country, for then his wife shall be saved and his children afterwards,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.498">and his house and property shall not be damaged, if the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.499">must go away with their ships to the beloved land of their fathers.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.500">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.501">But Aias on the other side called to his companions:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.502">'Shame, you Argives; here is the time of decision, whether</p>
	<p id="IL.15.503">we die, or live on still and beat back ruin from our vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.504">Do you expect, if our ships fall to helm-shining Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.505">you will walk each of you back dryshod to the land of your fathers?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.506">Do you not hear how Hektor is stirring up all his people,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.507">how he is raging to set fire to our ships? He is not</p>
	<p id="IL.15.508">inviting you to come to a dance. He invites you to battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.509">For us there can be no design, no purpose, better than this one,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.510">to close in and fight with the strength of our hands at close quarters.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.511">Better to take in a single time our chances of dying</p>
	<p id="IL.15.512">or living, than go on being squeezed in the stark encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.15.513">right up against our ships, as now, by men worse than we are.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.514">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.515">There Hektor killed the son of Perimedes, Schedios,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.516">lord of the men of Phokis; but Aias killed Laodamas,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.517">leader of the foot-soldiers, and shining son of Antenor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.518">Then Poulydamas stripped Otos of Kyllene, companion</p>
	<p id="IL.15.519">to Meges, Phyleus' son, and a lord among the great-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.15.520">Epeians. Meges seeing it lunged at him, but Poulydamas</p>
	<p id="IL.15.521">bent down and away, so that Meges missed him. Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.15.522">would not let Panthoös' son go down among the front fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.523">but Meges stabbed with the spear the middle of the chest of Kroismos.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.524">He fell, thunderously, and Meges was stripping the armour</p>
	<p id="IL.15.525">from his shoulders, but meanwhile Dolops lunged at him, Lampos'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.526">son, a man crafty with the spear and strongest of the sons born</p>
	<p id="IL.15.527">to Lampos, Laomedon's son, one skilled in furious fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.528">He from close up stabbed with his spear at the shield of Phyleides</p>
	<p id="IL.15.529">in the middle, but the corselet he wore defended him, solid</p>
	<p id="IL.15.530">and built with curving plates of metal, which in days past Phyleus</p>
	<p id="IL.15.531">had taken home from Ephyra and the river Selleëis.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.532">A guest and friend had given him it, lord of men, Euphetes,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.533">to carry into the fighting and beat off the attack of the enemy,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.534">and now it guarded the body of his son from destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.535">But Meges stabbed with the sharp spear at the uttermost summit</p>
	<p id="IL.15.536">of the brazen helmet thick with horse-hair, and tore off</p>
	<p id="IL.15.537">the mane of horse-hair from the helmet, so that it toppled</p>
	<p id="IL.15.538">groundward and lay in the dust in all its new shining of purple.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.539">Yet Dolops stood his ground and fought on, in hope still of winning,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.540">but meanwhile warlike Menelaos came to stand beside Meges,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.541">and came from the side and unobserved with his spear, and from behind</p>
	<p id="IL.15.542">threw at his shoulder, so the spear tore through his chest in its fury</p>
	<p id="IL.15.543">to drive on, so that Dolops reeled and went down, face forward.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.544">The two of them swept in to strip away from his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.15.545">the bronze armour, but Hektor called aloud to his brothers,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.546">the whole lot, but first scolded the son of Hiketaon,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.547">strong Melanippos. He in Perkote had tended his lumbering</p>
	<p id="IL.15.548">cattle, in the days before when the enemy were still far off;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.549">but when the oarswept ships of the Danaans came, then</p>
	<p id="IL.15.550">he returned to Ilion, and was a great man among the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.551">and lived with Priam, who honoured him as he honoured his children.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.552">Now Hektor spoke a word and called him by name and scolded him:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.553">'Shall we give way so, Melanippos? Does it mean nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.554">even to you in the inward heart that your cousin is fallen?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.555">Do you not see how they are busied over the armour of Dolops?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.556">Come on, then; no longer can we stand far off and fight with</p>
	<p id="IL.15.557">the Argives. Sooner we must kill them, or else sheer Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.15.558">be stormed utterly by them, and her citizens be killed.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.559">He spoke, and led the way, and the other followed, a mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.15.560">godlike. But huge Telamonian Aias stirred on the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.561">'Dear friends, be men; let shame be in your hearts, and discipline,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.562">and have consideration for each other in the strong encounters,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.563">since more come through alive when men consider each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.564">and there is no glory when they give way, nor warcraft either.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.565">He spoke, and they likewise grew furious in their defence,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.566">and put his word away in their hearts, and fenced in their vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.15.567">in a circle of bronze, but Zeus against them wakened the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.568">Then Menelaos of the great war cry stirred on Antilochos:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.569">'Antilochos, no other Achaian is younger than you are,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.570">nor faster on his feet, nor strong as you are in fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.571">You could make an outrush and strike down some man of the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.572">So speaking, he hastened back but stirred Antilochos onward,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.573">and he sprang forth from the champions and hefted the shining javelin,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.574">glaring round about him, and the Trojans gave way in the face</p>
	<p id="IL.15.575">of the man throwing with the spear. And he made no vain cast</p>
	<p id="IL.15.576">but struck Hiketaon's son, Melanippos the high-hearted,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.577">in the chest next to the nipple as he swept into the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.578">He fell, thunderously, and darkness closed over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.579">Antilochos sprang forth against him, as a hound rushes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.580">against a stricken fawn that as he broke from his covert</p>
	<p id="IL.15.581">a hunter has shot at, and hit, and broken his limbs' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.582">So Antilochos stubborn in battle sprang, Melanippos,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.583">at you, to strip your armour, but did not escape brilliant Hektor's</p>
	<p id="IL.15.584">notice, who came on the run through the fighting against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.585">Antilochos did not hold his ground, although a swift fighter,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.586">but fled away like a wild beast who has done some bad thing,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.587">one who has killed a hound or an ox-herd tending his cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.15.588">and escapes, before a gang of men has assembled against him;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.589">so Nestor's son ran away, and after him the Trojans and Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.15.590">with unearthly clamour showered their groaning weapons against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.591">He turned and stood when he got into the swarm of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.592">But the Trojans in the likeness of ravening lions swept on</p>
	<p id="IL.15.593">against the ships, and were bringing to accomplishment Zeus' orders,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.594">who wakened always the huge strength in them, dazed the courage</p>
	<p id="IL.15.595">of the Argives, and denied their glory, and stirred on the others.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.596">Zeus' desire was to give glory to the son of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.597">Hektor, that he might throw on the curved ships the inhuman</p>
	<p id="IL.15.598">weariless strength of fire, and so make completely accomplished</p>
	<p id="IL.15.599">the prayer of Thetis. Therefore Zeus of the counsels waited</p>
	<p id="IL.15.600">the sight before his eyes of the flare, when a single ship burned.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.601">From thereon he would make the attack of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.602">surge back again from the ships, and give the Danaans glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.603">With this in mind he drove on against the hollow ships Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.604">Priam's son, though Hektor without the god was in fury</p>
	<p id="IL.15.605">and raged, as when destructive fire or spear-shaking Ares</p>
	<p id="IL.15.606">rages among the mountains and dense places of the deep forest.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.607">A slaver came out around his mouth, and under the lowering</p>
	<p id="IL.15.608">brows his eyes were glittering, the helm on his temples</p>
	<p id="IL.15.609">was shaken and thundered horribly to the fighting of Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.610">Out of the bright sky Zeus himself was working to help him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.611">and among men so numerous he honoured this one man</p>
	<p id="IL.15.612">and glorified him, since Hektor was to have only a short life</p>
	<p id="IL.15.613">and already the day of his death was being driven upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.15.614">by Pallas Athene through the strength of Achilleus. And now</p>
	<p id="IL.15.615">he was probing the ranks of men, and trying to smash them,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.616">and made for where there were most men together, and the best armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.617">But even so he could not break them, for all his fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.618">for they closed into a wall and held him, like some towering</p>
	<p id="IL.15.619">huge sea-cliff that lies close along the grey salt water</p>
	<p id="IL.15.620">and stands up against the screaming winds and their sudden directions</p>
	<p id="IL.15.621">and against the waves that grow to bigness and burst up against it.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.622">So the Danaans stood steady against the Trojans, nor gave way.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.623">But he, lit about with flame on all sides, charged on their numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.15.624">and descended upon them as descends on a fast ship the battering</p>
	<p id="IL.15.625">wave storm-bred from beneath the clouds, and the ship goes utterly</p>
	<p id="IL.15.626">hidden under the foam, and the dangerous blast of the hurricane</p>
	<p id="IL.15.627">thunders against the sail, and the hearts of the seamen are shaken</p>
	<p id="IL.15.628">with fear, as they are carried only a little way out of death's reach.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.629">So the heart in the breast of each Achaian was troubled.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.630">Hektor came on against them, as a murderous lion on cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.15.631">who in the low-lying meadow of a great marsh pasture</p>
	<p id="IL.15.632">by hundreds, and among them a herdsman who does not quite know</p>
	<p id="IL.15.633">how to fight a wild beast off from killing a horn-curved</p>
	<p id="IL.15.634">ox, and keeps pace with the first and the last of the cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.15.635">always, but the lion making his spring at the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.15.636">eats an ox as the rest stampede; so now the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.637">fled in unearthly terror before father Zeus and Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.638">all, but he got one only, Periphetes of Mykenai,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.639">beloved son of Kopreus, who for the lord Eurystheus</p>
	<p id="IL.15.640">had gone often with messages to powerful Herakles.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.641">To him, a meaner father, was born a son who was better</p>
	<p id="IL.15.642">for all talents, in the speed of his feet and in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.15.643">and for intelligence counted among the first in Mykenai.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.644">Thereby now higher was the glory he granted to Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.645">For as he whirled about to get back, he fell over the out-rim</p>
	<p id="IL.15.646">of the shield he carried, which reached to his feet to keep the spears from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.647">Stumbling on this he went over on his back, and the helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.15.648">that circled his temples clashed horribly as he went down.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.649">Hektor saw it sharply, and ran up and stood beside him,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.650">and stuck the spear into his chest and killed him before the eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.15.651">of his dear friends, who for all their sorrowing could do nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.15.652">to help their companion, being themselves afraid of great Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.653">Now they had got among the ships, and the ends were about them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.654">of the ships hauled up in the first line, but the Trojans swarmed</p>
	<p id="IL.15.655">on them. The Argives under force gave back from the first line</p>
	<p id="IL.15.656">of their ships, but along the actual shelters they rallied</p>
	<p id="IL.15.657">in a group, and did not scatter along the encampment. Shame held them</p>
	<p id="IL.15.658">and fear. They kept up a continuous call to each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.659">and beyond others Gerenian Nestor, the Achaians' watcher,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.660">supplicated each man by the knees for the sake of his parents.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.661">'Dear friends, be men; let shame be in your hearts and discipline</p>
	<p id="IL.15.662">in the sight of other men, and each one of you remember</p>
	<p id="IL.15.663">his children and his wife, his property and his parents,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.664">whether a man's father and mother live or have died. Here now</p>
	<p id="IL.15.665">I supplicate your knees for the sake of those who are absent</p>
	<p id="IL.15.666">to stand strongly and not be turned to the terror of panic.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.667">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and heart in each man,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.668">and from their eyes Athene pushed the darkness immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.15.669">of mist, and the light came out hard against them on both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.15.670">whether they looked from the ships or from the closing of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.671">They knew Hektor of the great war cry, they knew his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.15.672">whether they stood away behind and out of the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.15.673">or whether alongside the fast ships they fought in the battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.674">Nor did it still please great-hearted Aias to stand back</p>
	<p id="IL.15.675">where the other sons of the Achaians had taken position;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.676">but he went in huge strides up and down the decks of the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.677">He wielded in his hands a great pike for sea fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.678">twenty-two cubits long and joined together by clinchers.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.679">And as a man who is an expert rider of horses</p>
	<p id="IL.15.680">who when he has chosen and coupled four horses out of many</p>
	<p id="IL.15.681">makes his way over the plain galloping toward a great city</p>
	<p id="IL.15.682">along the travelled road, and many turn to admire him,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.683">men or women, while he steadily and never slipping</p>
	<p id="IL.15.684">jumps and shifts his stance from one to another as they gallop;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.685">so Aias ranged crossing from deck to deck of the fast ships</p>
	<p id="IL.15.686">taking huge strides, and his voice went always up to the bright sky</p>
	<p id="IL.15.687">as he kept up a terrible bellow and urged on the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.688">to defend their ships and their shelters, while on the other side Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.15.689">would not stay back among the mass of close-armoured Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.690">but as a flashing eagle makes his plunge upon other</p>
	<p id="IL.15.691">flying birds as these feed in a swarm by a river,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.692">whether these be geese or cranes or swans long-throated,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.693">so Hektor steered the course of his outrush straight for a vessel</p>
	<p id="IL.15.694">with dark prows, and from behind Zeus was pushing him onward</p>
	<p id="IL.15.695">hard with his big hand, and stirred on his people beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.696">Now once again a grim battle was fought by the vessels;</p>
	<p id="IL.15.697">you would say that they faced each other unbruised, unwearied</p>
	<p id="IL.15.698">in the fighting, from the speed in which they went for each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.699">This was the thought in each as they struggled on: the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.15.700">thought they could not get clear of the evil, but must perish,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.701">while the heart inside each one of the Trojans was hopeful</p>
	<p id="IL.15.702">to set fire to the ships and kill the fighting men of Achaia.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.703">With such thoughts in mind they stood up to fight with each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.704">Hektor caught hold of the stern of a grand, fast-running,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.705">seafaring ship, that once had carried Protesilaos</p>
	<p id="IL.15.706">to Troy, and did not take him back to the land of his fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.707">It was around his ship that now Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.15.708">cut each other down at close quarters, nor any longer</p>
	<p id="IL.15.709">had patience for the volleys exchanged from bows and javelins</p>
	<p id="IL.15.710">but stood up close against each other, matching their fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.711">and fought their battle with sharp hatchets and axes, with great</p>
	<p id="IL.15.712">swords and with leaf-headed pikes, and many magnificent</p>
	<p id="IL.15.713">swords were scattered along the ground, black-thonged, heavy-hilted,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.714">sometimes dropping from the hands, some glancing from shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.15.715">of men as they fought, so the ground ran black with blood. Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.15.716">would not let go of the stern of a ship where he had caught hold of it</p>
	<p id="IL.15.717">but gripped the sternpost in his hands and called to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.718">'Bring fire, and give single voice to the clamour of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.719">Now Zeus has given us a day worth all the rest of them:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.720">the ships' capture, the ships that came here in spite of the gods' will</p>
	<p id="IL.15.721">and have visited much pain on us, by our counsellors' cowardice</p>
	<p id="IL.15.722">who would not let me fight by the grounded ships, though I wanted to,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.723">but held me back in restraint, and curbed in our fighters.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.724">But Zeus of the wide brows, though then he fouled our intentions,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.725">comes now himself to urge us on and give us encouragement.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.726">He spoke, and they thereby came on harder against the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.727">Their volleys were too much for Aias, who could hold no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.15.728">his place, but had to give back a little, expecting to die there,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.729">back to the seven-foot midship, and gave up the high deck of the balanced</p>
	<p id="IL.15.730">ship. There he stood and waited for them, and with his pike always</p>
	<p id="IL.15.731">beat off any Trojan who carried persistent fire from the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.732">He kept up a terrible bellowing, and urged on the Danaans:</p>
	<p id="IL.15.733">'Friends and fighting men of the Danaans, henchmen of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.734">be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.735">Do we think there are others who stand behind us to help us?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.736">Have we some stronger wall that can rescue men from perdition?</p>
	<p id="IL.15.737">We have no city built strong with towers lying near us, within which</p>
	<p id="IL.15.738">we could defend ourselves and hold off this host that matches us.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.739">We hold position in this plain of the close-armoured Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.740">bent back against the sea, and far from the land of our fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.741">Salvation's light is in our hands' work, not the mercy of battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.15.742">He spoke, and came forward with his sharp spear, raging for battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.15.743">And whenever some Trojan crashed against the hollow ships</p>
	<p id="IL.15.744">with burning fire, who sought to wake the favour of Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.15.745">Aias would wait for him and then stab with the long pike</p>
	<p id="IL.15.746">and so from close up wounded twelve in front of the vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.1">So they fought on both sides for the sake of the strong-benched vessel.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.2">Meanwhile Patroklos came to the shepherd of the people, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.3">and stood by him and wept warm tears, like a spring dark-running</p>
	<p id="IL.16.4">that down the face of a rock impassable drips its dim water;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.5">and swift-footed brilliant Achilleus looked on him in pity,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.6">and spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words: 'Why then</p>
	<p id="IL.16.7">are you crying like some poor little girl, Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.8">who runs after her mother and begs to be picked up and carried,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.9">and clings to her dress, and holds her back when she tries to hurry,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.10">and gazes tearfully into her face, until she is picked up?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.11">You are like such a one, Patroklos, dropping these soft tears.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.12">Could you have some news to tell, for me or the Myrmidons?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.13">Have you, and nobody else, received some message from Phthia?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.14">Yet they tell me Aktor's son Menoitios lives still</p>
	<p id="IL.16.15">and Aiakos' son Peleus lives still among the Myrmidons.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.16">If either of these died we should take it hard. Or is it</p>
	<p id="IL.16.17">the Argives you are mourning over, and how they are dying</p>
	<p id="IL.16.18">against the hollow ships by reason of their own arrogance?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.19">Tell me, do not hide it in your mind, and so we shall both know.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.20">Then groaning heavily, Patroklos the rider, you answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.21">'Son of Peleus, far greatest of the Achaians, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.22">do not be angry; such grief has fallen upon the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.23">For all those who were before the bravest in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.16.24">are lying up among the ships with arrow or spear wounds.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.25">The son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes, was hit by an arrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.26">and Odysseus has a pike wound, and Agamemnon the spear-famed,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.27">and Eurypylos has been wounded in the thigh with an arrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.28">And over these the healers skilled in medicine are working</p>
	<p id="IL.16.29">to cure their wounds. But you, Achilleus; who can do anything</p>
	<p id="IL.16.30">with you? May no such anger take me as this that you cherish!</p>
	<p id="IL.16.31">Cursed courage. What other man born hereafter shall be advantaged</p>
	<p id="IL.16.32">unless you beat aside from the Argives this shameful destruction?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.33">Pitiless: the rider Peleus was never your father</p>
	<p id="IL.16.34">nor Thetis was your mother, but it was the grey sea that bore you</p>
	<p id="IL.16.35">and the towering rocks, so sheer the heart in you is turned from us.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.36">But if you are drawing back from some prophecy known in your own heart</p>
	<p id="IL.16.37">and by Zeus' will your honoured mother has told you of something,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.38">then send me out at least, let the rest of the Myrmidon people</p>
	<p id="IL.16.39">follow me, and I may be a light given to the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.40">Give me your armour to wear on my shoulders into the fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.41">so perhaps the Trojans might think I am you, and give way</p>
	<p id="IL.16.42">from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind</p>
	<p id="IL.16.43">again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.44">We unwearied might with a mere cry pile men wearied</p>
	<p id="IL.16.45">back upon their city, and away from the ships and the shelters.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.46">So he spoke supplicating in his great innocence; this was</p>
	<p id="IL.16.47">his own death and evil destruction he was entreating.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.48">But now, deeply troubled, swift-footed Achilleus answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.49">'Ah, Patroklos, illustrious, what is this you are saying?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.50">I have not any prophecy in mind that I know of;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.51">there is no word from Zeus my honoured mother has told me,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.52">but this thought comes as a bitter sorrow to my heart and my spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.16.53">when a man tries to foul one who is his equal, to take back</p>
	<p id="IL.16.54">a prize of honour, because he goes in greater authority.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.55">This is a bitter thought to me; my desire has been dealt with</p>
	<p id="IL.16.56">roughly. The girl the sons of the Achaians chose out for my honour,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.57">and I won her with my own spear, and stormed a strong-fenced city,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.58">is taken back out of my hands by powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.59">the son of Atreus, as if I were some dishonoured vagabond.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.60">Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past; and it was not</p>
	<p id="IL.16.61">in my heart to be angry forever; and yet I have said</p>
	<p id="IL.16.62">I would not give over my anger until that time came</p>
	<p id="IL.16.63">when the fighting with all its clamour came up to my own ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.64">So do you draw my glorious armour about your shoulders;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.65">lead the Myrmidons whose delight is battle into the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.66">if truly the black cloud of the Trojans has taken position</p>
	<p id="IL.16.67">strongly about our ships, and the others, the Argives, are bent back</p>
	<p id="IL.16.68">against the beach of the sea, holding only a narrow division</p>
	<p id="IL.16.69">of land, and the whole city of the Trojans has descended upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.70">boldly; because they do not see the face of my helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.71">glaring close; or else they would run and cram full of dead men</p>
	<p id="IL.16.72">the water-courses; if powerful Agamemnon treated me</p>
	<p id="IL.16.73">kindly. Now the Argives fight for their very encampment.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.74">For the spear rages not now in the hands of the son of Tydeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.75">Diomedes, to beat destruction aside from the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.76">nor have I heard the voice of the son of Atreus crying</p>
	<p id="IL.16.77">from his hated head; no, but the voice of murderous Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.78">calling to the Trojans crashes about my ears; with their war cry</p>
	<p id="IL.16.79">they hold the entire plain as they beat the Achaians in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.80">But even so, Patroklos, beat the bane aside from our ships; fall</p>
	<p id="IL.16.81">upon them with all your strength; let them not with fire's blazing</p>
	<p id="IL.16.82">inflame our ships, and take away our desired homecoming.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.83">But obey to the end this word I put upon your attention</p>
	<p id="IL.16.84">so that you can win, for me, great honour and glory</p>
	<p id="IL.16.85">in the sight of all the Danaans, so they will bring back to me</p>
	<p id="IL.16.86">the lovely girl, and give me shining gifts in addition.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.87">When you have driven them from the ships, come back; although later</p>
	<p id="IL.16.88">the thunderous lord of Hera might grant you the winning of glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.89">you must not set your mind on fighting the Trojans, whose delight</p>
	<p id="IL.16.90">is in battle, without me. So you will diminish my honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.91">You must not, in the pride and fury of fighting, go on</p>
	<p id="IL.16.92">slaughtering the Trojans, and lead the way against Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.93">for fear some one of the everlasting gods on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.94">might crush you. Apollo who works from afar loves these people</p>
	<p id="IL.16.95">dearly. You must turn back once you bring the light of salvation</p>
	<p id="IL.16.96">to the ships, and let the others go on fighting in the flat land.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.97">Father Zeus, Athene and Apollo, if only</p>
	<p id="IL.16.98">not one of all the Trojans could escape destruction, not one</p>
	<p id="IL.16.99">of the Argives, but you and I could emerge from the slaughter</p>
	<p id="IL.16.100">so that we two alone could break Troy's hallowed coronal.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.101">Now as these two were talking thus to each other, meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.16.102">the volleys were too much for Aias, who could hold no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.16.103">his place. The will of Zeus beat him back, and the proud Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.16.104">with their spears, and around his temples the shining helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.105">clashed horribly under the shower of strokes; he was hit constantly</p>
	<p id="IL.16.106">on the strong-wrought cheek-pieces, and his left shoulder was tiring</p>
	<p id="IL.16.107">from always holding up the big glittering shield; yet they could not</p>
	<p id="IL.16.108">beat him out of his place, though they piled their missiles upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.109">His breath came ever hard and painful, the sweat ran pouring</p>
	<p id="IL.16.110">down his body from every limb, he could find no means</p>
	<p id="IL.16.111">to catch his breath, but evil was piled on evil about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.112">Tell me now, you Muses who have your homes on Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.113">how fire was first thrown upon the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.114">Hektor stood up close to Aias and hacked at the ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.16.115">with his great sword, striking behind the socket of the spearhead,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.116">and slashed it clean away, so that Telamonian Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.16.117">shook there in his hand a lopped spear, while far away from him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.118">the bronze spearhead fell echoing to the ground; and Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.16.119">knew in his blameless heart, and shivered for knowing it, how this</p>
	<p id="IL.16.120">was gods' work, how Zeus high-thundering cut across the intention</p>
	<p id="IL.16.121">in all his battle, how he planned that the Trojans should conquer.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.122">He drew away out of the missiles, and the Trojans threw weariless fire</p>
	<p id="IL.16.123">on the fast ship, and suddenly the quenchless flame streamed over it.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.124">So the fire was at work on the ship's stern; but Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.125">struck his hands against both his thighs, and called to Patroklos:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.126">'Rise up, illustrious Patroklos, rider of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.127">I see how the ravening fire goes roaring over our vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.128">They must not get our ships so we cannot run away in them.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.129">Get on your armour; faster; I will muster our people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.130">He spoke, and Patroklos was helming himself in bronze that glittered.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.131">First he placed along his legs the beautiful greaves, linked</p>
	<p id="IL.16.132">with silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.133">Afterwards he girt on about his chest the corselet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.134">starry and elaborate of swift-footed Aiakides.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.135">Across his shoulders he slung the sword with the nails of silver,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.136">a bronze sword, and above it the great shield, huge and heavy.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.137">Over his mighty head he set the well-fashioned helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.138">with the horse-hair crest, and the plumes nodded terribly above it.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.139">He took up two powerful spears that fitted his hand's grip,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.140">only he did not take the spear of blameless Aiakides,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.141">huge, heavy, thick, which no one else of all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.142">could handle, but Achilleus alone knew how to wield it;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.143">the Pelian ash spear which Cheiron had brought to his father</p>
	<p id="IL.16.144">from high on Pelion to be death for fighters. Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.145">ordered Automedon rapidly to harness the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.146">a man he honoured most, after Achilleus breaker of battles,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.147">who stood most staunchly by him against the fury of fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.148">For him Automedon led the fast-running horses under</p>
	<p id="IL.16.149">the yoke, Xanthos and Balios, who tore with the winds' speed,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.150">horses stormy Podarge once conceived of the west wind</p>
	<p id="IL.16.151">and bore, as she grazed in the meadow beside the swirl of the Ocean.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.152">In the traces beside these he put unfaulted Pedasos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.153">whom Achilleus brought back once when he stormed Eëtion's city.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.154">He, mortal as he was, ran beside the immortal horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.155">But Achilleus went meanwhile to the Myrmidons, and arrayed them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.156">all in their war gear along the shelters. And they, as wolves</p>
	<p id="IL.16.157">who tear flesh raw, in whose hearts the battle fury is tireless,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.158">who have brought down a great horned stag in the mountains, and then feed</p>
	<p id="IL.16.159">on him, till the jowls of every wolf run blood, and then go</p>
	<p id="IL.16.160">all in a pack to drink from a spring of dark-running water,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.161">lapping with their lean tongues along the black edge of the surface</p>
	<p id="IL.16.162">and belching up the clotted blood; in the heart of each one</p>
	<p id="IL.16.163">is a spirit untremulous, but their bellies are full and groaning;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.164">as such the lords of the Myrmidons and their men of counsel</p>
	<p id="IL.16.165">around the brave henchman of swift-footed Aiakides</p>
	<p id="IL.16.166">swarmed, and among them was standing warlike Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.167">and urged on the fighting men with their shields, and the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.168">Fifty were the fast-running ships wherein Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.169">beloved of Zeus had led his men to Troy, and in each one</p>
	<p id="IL.16.170">were fifty men, his companions in arms, at the rowing benches.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.171">He had made five leaders among them, and to these entrusted</p>
	<p id="IL.16.172">the command, while he in his great power was lord over all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.173">One battalion was led by Menesthios of the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.16.174">corselet, son of Spercheios, the river swelled from the bright sky,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.175">born of the daughter of Peleus, Polydore the lovely,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.176">to unremitting Spercheios, when a woman lay with an immortal;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.177">but born in name to Perieres' son, Boros, who married</p>
	<p id="IL.16.178">Polydore formally, and gave gifts beyond count to win her.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.179">The next battalion was led by warlike Eudoros, a maiden's</p>
	<p id="IL.16.180">child, born to one lovely in the dance, Polymele,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.181">daughter of Phylas; whom strong Hermes Argeiphontes</p>
	<p id="IL.16.182">loved, when he watched her with his eyes among the girls dancing</p>
	<p id="IL.16.183">in the choir for clamorous Artemis of the golden distaff.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.184">Presently Hermes the healer went up with her into her chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.16.185">and lay secretly with her, and she bore him a son, the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.16.186">Eudoros, a surpassing runner and a quick man in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.187">But after Eileithyia of the hard pains had brought out</p>
	<p id="IL.16.188">the child into the light, and he looked on the sun's shining,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.189">Aktor's son Echekles in the majesty of his great power</p>
	<p id="IL.16.190">led her to his house, when he had given numberless gifts to win her,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.191">and the old man Phylas took the child and brought him up kindly</p>
	<p id="IL.16.192">and cared for him, in affection as if he had been his own son.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.193">The leader of the third battalion was warlike Peisandros,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.194">Maimalos' son, who outshone all the rest of the Myrmidons</p>
	<p id="IL.16.195">in spear-fighting, next to Peleian Achilleus' henchman.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.196">The fourth battalion was led by Phoinix, the aged horseman,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.197">the fifth by Alkimedon, the blameless son of Laerkes.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.198">But after Achilleus gave them their stations all in good order</p>
	<p id="IL.16.199">beside their leaders, he laid his stern injunction upon them:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.200">'Myrmidons: not one of you can forget those mutterings,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.201">those threats that beside the running ships you made at the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.16.202">in all the time of my anger, and it was I you were blaming,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.203">as: "Hard son of Peleus! Your mother nursed you on gall. You have no</p>
	<p id="IL.16.204">pity, to keep your companions here by the ships unwilling.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.205">We should go back home again, then, in our seafaring vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.16.206">now that this wretched anger has befallen your spirit."</p>
	<p id="IL.16.207">Often you would gather in groups and so mutter against me,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.208">and now is shown a great work of that fighting you longed for.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.209">Then let each man take heart of strength to fight with the Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.210">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.211">and their ranks, as they listened to the king, pulled closer together.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.212">And as a man builds solid a wall with stones set close together</p>
	<p id="IL.16.213">for the rampart of a high house keeping out the force of the winds, so</p>
	<p id="IL.16.214">close together were the helms and shields massive in the middle.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.215">For shield leaned on shield, helmet on helmet, man against man,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.216">and the horse-hair crests along the horns of the shining helmets</p>
	<p id="IL.16.217">touched as they bent their heads, so dense were they formed on each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.218">And before them all were two men in their armour, Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.219">and Automedon, both of them in one single fury</p>
	<p id="IL.16.220">to fight in front of the Myrmidons. But meanwhile Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.221">went off into his shelter, and lifted the lid from a lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.16.222">elaborately wrought chest, which Thetis the silver-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.16.223">had put in his ship to carry, and filled it fairly with tunics</p>
	<p id="IL.16.224">and mantles to hold the wind from a man, and with fleecy blankets.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.225">Inside this lay a wrought goblet, nor did any other</p>
	<p id="IL.16.226">man drink the shining wine from it nor did Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.227">pour from it to any other god, but only Zeus father.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.228">He took this now out of the chest, and cleaned it with sulphur</p>
	<p id="IL.16.229">first, and afterwards washed it out in bright-running water,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.230">and washed his own hands, and poured shining wine into the goblet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.231">and stood in his middle forecourt and prayed, and poured the wine, looking</p>
	<p id="IL.16.232">into the sky, not unseen by Zeus who delights in the thunder:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.233">'High Zeus, lord of Dodona, Pelasgian, living afar off,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.234">brooding over wintry Dodona, your prophets about you</p>
	<p id="IL.16.235">living, the Selloi who sleep on the ground with feet unwashed. Hear me.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.236">As one time before when I prayed to you, you listened</p>
	<p id="IL.16.237">and did me honour, and smote strongly the host of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.238">so one more time bring to pass the wish that I pray for.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.239">For see, I myself am staying where the ships are assembled,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.240">but I send out my companion and many Myrmidons with him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.241">to fight. Let glory, Zeus of the wide brows, go forth with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.242">Make brave the heart inside his breast, so that even Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.243">will find out whether our henchman knows how to fight his battles</p>
	<p id="IL.16.244">by himself, or whether his hands rage invincible only</p>
	<p id="IL.16.245">those times when I myself go into the grind of the war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.246">But when he has beaten back from the ships their clamorous onset,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.247">then let him come back to me and the running ships, unwounded,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.248">with all his armour and with the companions who fight close beside him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.249">So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.250">The father granted him one prayer, and denied him the other.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.251">That Patroklos should beat back the fighting assault on the vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.16.252">he allowed, but refused to let him come back safe out of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.253">When Achilleus had poured the wine and prayed to Zeus father</p>
	<p id="IL.16.254">he went back into the shelter, stowed the cup in the chest, and came out</p>
	<p id="IL.16.255">to stand in front of the door, with the desire in his heart still</p>
	<p id="IL.16.256">to watch the grim encounter of Achaians and Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.257">Now they who were armed in the company of great-hearted Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.258">went onward, until in high confidence they charged on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.259">The Myrmidons came streaming out like wasps at the wayside</p>
	<p id="IL.16.260">when little boys have got into the habit of making them angry</p>
	<p id="IL.16.261">by always teasing them as they live in their house by the roadside;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.262">silly boys, they do something that hurts many people;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.263">and if some man who travels on the road happens to pass them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.264">and stirs them unintentionally, they in heart of fury</p>
	<p id="IL.16.265">come swarming out each one from his place to fight for their children.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.266">In heart and in fury like these the Myrmidons streaming</p>
	<p id="IL.16.267">came out from their ships, with a tireless clamour arising,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.268">and Patroklos called afar in a great voice to his companions:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.269">'Myrmidons, companions of Peleus' son, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.270">be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.271">we must bring honour to Peleus' son, far the greatest of the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.16.272">by the ships, we, even the henchmen who fight beside him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.273">so Atreus' son wide-ruling Agamemnon may recognize</p>
	<p id="IL.16.274">his madness, that he did no honour to the best of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.275">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit and strength in each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.276">They fell upon the Trojans in a pack, and about them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.277">the ships echoed terribly to the roaring Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.278">But the Trojans, when they saw the powerful son of Menoitios</p>
	<p id="IL.16.279">himself and his henchman with him in the glare of their war gear,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.280">the heart was stirred in all of them, the battalions were shaken</p>
	<p id="IL.16.281">in the expectation that by the ships swift-footed Peleion</p>
	<p id="IL.16.282">had thrown away his anger and chosen the way of friendship.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.283">Then each man looked about him for a way to escape the sheer death.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.284">Patroklos was the first man to make a cast with the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.16.285">spear, straight through the middle fighting, where most men were stricken,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.286">beside the stern on the ship of great-hearted Protesilaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.287">and struck Pyraichmes, who had led the lords of Paionian</p>
	<p id="IL.16.288">horses from Amydon and the wide waters of Axios.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.289">He struck him in the right shoulder, so he dropped in the dust groaning,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.290">on his back, and his Paionian companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.291">scattered; for Patroklos drove the fear into all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.292">when he cut down their leader, the best of them all in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.293">He drove them from the ships and put out the fire that was blazing,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.294">and that ship was left half-burnt as it was, as the Trojans scattered</p>
	<p id="IL.16.295">in terror and unearthly noise, and the Danaans streamed back</p>
	<p id="IL.16.296">along the hollow ships, and clamour incessant rose up.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.297">And as when from the towering height of a great mountain Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.298">who gathers the thunderflash stirs the cloud dense upon it,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.299">and all the high places of the hills are clear and the shoulders out-jutting</p>
	<p id="IL.16.300">and the deep ravines, as endless bright air spills from the heavens,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.301">so when the Danaans had beaten from their ships the ravening</p>
	<p id="IL.16.302">fire, they got breath for a little, but there was no check in the fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.303">for the Trojans under the attack of the warlike Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.304">had not yet turned their faces to run away from the black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.305">They stood yet against them, but gave way from the ships under pressure.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.306">There man killed man all along the scattered encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.16.307">of the leaders, and first among them, the strong son of Menoitios,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.308">threw and struck Areïlykos in the thigh, as he turned</p>
	<p id="IL.16.309">back, with the sharp point of the spear, and drove the bronze clean through.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.310">The spear smashed in the bone and he fell to the ground headlong</p>
	<p id="IL.16.311">on his face. Meanwhile warlike Menelaos stabbed Thoas</p>
	<p id="IL.16.312">in the chest where it was left bare by the shield, and unstrung his limbs' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.313">Meges, Phyleus' son, watched Amphiklos as he came on</p>
	<p id="IL.16.314">and was too quick with a stab at the base of the leg, where the muscle</p>
	<p id="IL.16.315">of a man grows thickest, so that on the spearhead the sinew</p>
	<p id="IL.16.316">was torn apart, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.317">Of the sons of Nestor one, Antilochos, stabbed Atymnios</p>
	<p id="IL.16.318">with the sharp spear, and drove the bronze head clean through his flank, so</p>
	<p id="IL.16.319">that he fell forward; but Maris with the spear from close up</p>
	<p id="IL.16.320">made a lunge at Antilochos in rage for his brother</p>
	<p id="IL.16.321">standing in front of the corpse, but before him godlike Thrasymedes</p>
	<p id="IL.16.322">was in with a thrust before he could stab, nor missed his quick stroke</p>
	<p id="IL.16.323">into the shoulder, and the spearhead shore off the arm's base</p>
	<p id="IL.16.324">clear away from the muscles and torn from the bone utterly.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.325">He fell, thunderously, and darkness closed over both eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.326">So these two, beaten down under the hands of two brothers,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.327">descended to the dark place, Sarpedon's noble companions</p>
	<p id="IL.16.328">and spear-throwing sons of Amisodaros, the one who had nourished</p>
	<p id="IL.16.329">the furious Chimaira to be an evil to many.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.330">Aias, Oïleus' son, in an outrush caught Kleoboulos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.331">alive, where he was fouled in the running confusion, and there</p>
	<p id="IL.16.332">unstrung his strength, hewing with the hilted sword at the neck,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.333">so all the sword was smoking with blood and over both eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.16.334">closed the red death and the strong destiny. Then Peneleos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.335">and Lykon ran up close together, since these with their spear-throws</p>
	<p id="IL.16.336">had gone wide of each other, and each had made a cast vainly.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.337">So now the two of them ran together with swords. There Lykon</p>
	<p id="IL.16.338">hacked at the horn of the horse-hair crested helm, but the sword blade</p>
	<p id="IL.16.339">broke at the socket; Peneleos cut at the neck underneath</p>
	<p id="IL.16.340">the ear, and the sword sank clean inside, with only skin left</p>
	<p id="IL.16.341">to hold it, and the head slumped aside, and the limbs were loosened.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.342">Meriones on his light feet overtaking Akamas</p>
	<p id="IL.16.343">stabbed him in the right shoulder as he climbed up behind his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.16.344">and the darkness drifted over his eyes as he crashed from the chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.345">Idomeneus stabbed Erymas in the mouth with the pitiless</p>
	<p id="IL.16.346">bronze, so that the brazen spearhead smashed its way clean through</p>
	<p id="IL.16.347">below the brain in an upward stroke, and the white bones splintered,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.348">and the teeth were shaken out with the stroke and both eyes filled up</p>
	<p id="IL.16.349">with blood, and gaping he blew a spray of blood through the nostrils</p>
	<p id="IL.16.350">and through his mouth, and death in a dark mist closed in about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.351">So these lords of the Danaans killed each his own man.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.352">They as wolves make havoc among lambs or young goats in their fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.353">catching them out of the flocks, when the sheep separate in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.16.354">through the thoughtlessness of the shepherd, and the wolves seeing them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.355">suddenly snatch them away, and they have no heart for fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.356">so the Danaans ravaged the Trojans, and these remembered</p>
	<p id="IL.16.357">the bitter sound of terror, and forgot their furious valour.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.358">But the great Aias was trying forever to make a spearcast</p>
	<p id="IL.16.359">at bronze-helmed Hektor, but he in his experience of fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.16.360">with his broad shoulders huddled under the bull's-hide shield kept</p>
	<p id="IL.16.361">watching always the whistle of arrows, the crash of spears thrown.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.362">He knew well how the strength of the fighting shifted against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.363">but even so stood his ground to save his steadfast companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.364">As when a cloud goes deep into the sky from Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.365">through the bright upper air when Zeus brings on the hurricane,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.366">so rose from beside the ships their outcry, the noise of their terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.367">In no good order they went back, while his fast-running horses</p>
	<p id="IL.16.368">carried Hektor away in his armour; he abandoned the people</p>
	<p id="IL.16.369">of the Trojans, who were trapped by the deep-dug ditch unwilling,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.370">and in the ditch many fast horses who pulled the chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.16.371">left, broken short at the joining of the pole, their masters' chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.16.372">while Patroklos was on them, calling hard and loud to the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.16.373">with evil intention for the Trojans, who, in clamorous terror,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.374">choked all the ways where they were cut off; from under their feet stirred</p>
	<p id="IL.16.375">the dust-storm scattered in clouds, their single-foot horses were straining</p>
	<p id="IL.16.376">to get back to the city away from the ships and the shelters.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.377">But Patroklos, where he saw the stirring of most people,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.378">steered there, shouting, and men went down under the axles</p>
	<p id="IL.16.379">headlong from chariots as the empty cars rattled onward.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.380">Straight across the ditch overleapt those swift and immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.16.381">horses the gods had given as shining gifts to Peleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.382">hurtling onward, as Patroklos' rage stirred him against Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.383">whom he tried to strike, but his fast horses carried him out of it.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.384">As underneath the hurricane all the black earth is burdened</p>
	<p id="IL.16.385">on an autumn day, when Zeus sends down the most violent waters</p>
	<p id="IL.16.386">in deep rage against mortals after they stir him to anger</p>
	<p id="IL.16.387">because in violent assembly they pass decrees that are crooked,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.388">and drive righteousness from among them and care nothing for what the gods think,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.389">and all the rivers of these men swell current to full spate</p>
	<p id="IL.16.390">and in the ravines of their water-courses rip all the hillsides</p>
	<p id="IL.16.391">and dash whirling in huge noise down to the blue sea, out of</p>
	<p id="IL.16.392">the mountains headlong, so that the works of men are diminished;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.393">so huge rose the noise from the horses of Troy in their running.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.394">But Patroklos, when he had cut away their first battalions,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.395">turned back to pin them against the ships, and would not allow them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.396">to climb back into their city though they strained for it, but sweeping</p>
	<p id="IL.16.397">through the space between the ships, the high wall, and the river,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.398">made havoc and exacted from them the blood price for many.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.399">There first of all he struck with the shining spear Pronoös</p>
	<p id="IL.16.400">in the chest where it was left bare by the shield, and unstrung his limbs' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.401">He fell, thunderously, and Patroklos in his next outrush</p>
	<p id="IL.16.402">at Thestor, Enops' son, who huddled inside his chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.403">shrunk back, he had lost all his nerve, and from his hands the reins</p>
	<p id="IL.16.404">slipped--Patroklos coming close up to him stabbed with a spear-thrust</p>
	<p id="IL.16.405">at the right side of the jaw and drove it on through the teeth, then</p>
	<p id="IL.16.406">hooked and dragged him with the spear over the rail, as a fisherman</p>
	<p id="IL.16.407">who sits out on the jut of a rock with line and glittering</p>
	<p id="IL.16.408">bronze hook drags a fish, who is thus doomed, out of the water.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.409">So he hauled him, mouth open to the bright spear, out of the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.410">and shoved him over on his face, and as he fell the life left him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.411">Next he struck Erylaos, as he swept in, with a great stone</p>
	<p id="IL.16.412">in the middle of the head, and all the head broke into two pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.16.413">inside the heavy helmet, and he in the dust face downward</p>
	<p id="IL.16.414">dropped while death breaking the spirit drifted about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.415">Afterwards with Erymas, Amphoteros, and Epaltes,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.416">Tlepolemos Damastor's son, Echios and Pyris,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.417">Ipheus and Euippos, and Argeas' son Polymelos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.418">all these he felled to the bountiful earth in rapid succession.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.419">But Sarpedon, when he saw his free-girt companions going</p>
	<p id="IL.16.420">down underneath the hands of Menoitios' son Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.421">called aloud in entreaty upon the godlike Lykians:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.422">'Shame, you Lykians, where are you running to? You must be fierce now,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.423">for I myself will encounter this man, so I may find out</p>
	<p id="IL.16.424">who this is who has so much strength and has done so much evil</p>
	<p id="IL.16.425">to the Trojans, since many and brave are those whose knees he has unstrung.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.426">He spoke, and sprang to the ground in all his arms from the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.427">and on the other side Patroklos when he saw him leapt down</p>
	<p id="IL.16.428">from his chariot. They as two hook-clawed beak-bent vultures</p>
	<p id="IL.16.429">above a tall rock face, high-screaming, go for each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.430">so now these two, crying aloud, encountered together.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.431">And watching them the son of devious-devising Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.432">was pitiful, and spoke to Hera, his wife and his sister:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.433">'Ah me, that it is destined that the dearest of men, Sarpedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.434">must go down under the hands of Menoitios' son Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.435">The heart in my breast is balanced between two ways as I ponder,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.436">whether I should snatch him out of the sorrowful battle</p>
	<p id="IL.16.437">and set him down still alive in the rich country of Lykia,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.438">or beat him under at the hands of the son of Menoitios.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.439">In turn the lady Hera of the ox eyes answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.440">'Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.441">Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since</p>
	<p id="IL.16.442">doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.443">Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.444">And put away in your thoughts this other thing I tell you;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.445">if you bring Sarpedon back to his home, still living,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.446">think how then some other one of the gods might also</p>
	<p id="IL.16.447">wish to carry his own son out of the strong encounter;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.448">since around the great city of Priam are fighting many</p>
	<p id="IL.16.449">sons of the immortals. You will waken grim resentment among them.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.450">No, but if he is dear to you, and your heart mourns for him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.451">then let him be, and let him go down in the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.16.452">underneath the hands of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.453">but after the soul and the years of his life have left him, then send</p>
	<p id="IL.16.454">Death to carry him away, and Sleep, who is painless,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.455">until they come with him to the countryside of broad Lykia</p>
	<p id="IL.16.456">where his brothers and countrymen shall give him due burial</p>
	<p id="IL.16.457">with tomb and gravestone. Such is the privilege of those who have perished.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.458">She spoke, nor did the father of gods and men disobey her;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.459">yet he wept tears of blood that fell to the ground, for the sake</p>
	<p id="IL.16.460">of his beloved son, whom now Patroklos was presently</p>
	<p id="IL.16.461">to kill, by generous Troy and far from the land of his fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.462">Now as these two advancing had come close to each other</p>
	<p id="IL.16.463">there Patroklos threw first at glorious Thrasymelos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.464">who was the strong henchman of lord Sarpedon, and struck him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.465">in the depth of the lower belly, and unstrung his limbs' strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.466">Sarpedon with the second throw then missed with the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.16.467">spear, but the spear fixed in the right shoulder of Pedasos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.468">the horse, who screamed as he blew his life away, and went down</p>
	<p id="IL.16.469">in shrill noise into the dust, and the life spirit flittered from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.470">The other horses shied apart, the yoke creaked, the guide reins</p>
	<p id="IL.16.471">were fouled together as the trace horse lay in the dust beside them;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.472">but at this spear-famed Automedon saw what he must do</p>
	<p id="IL.16.473">and wrenching out the long-edged sword from beside his big thigh</p>
	<p id="IL.16.474">in a flashing stroke and without faltering cut loose the trace horse</p>
	<p id="IL.16.475">and the other horses were straightened out, and pulled in the guide reins,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.476">and the two heroes came together in the heart-perishing battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.477">Once again Sarpedon threw wide with a cast of his shining</p>
	<p id="IL.16.478">spear, so that the pointed head overshot the left shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.16.479">of Patroklos; and now Patroklos made the second cast with the brazen</p>
	<p id="IL.16.480">spear, and the shaft escaping his hand was not flung vainly</p>
	<p id="IL.16.481">but struck where the beating heart is closed in the arch of the muscles.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.482">He fell, as when an oak goes down or a white poplar,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.483">or like a towering pine tree which in the mountains the carpenters</p>
	<p id="IL.16.484">have hewn down with their whetted axes to make a ship-timber.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.485">So he lay there felled in front of his horses and chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.16.486">roaring, and clawed with his hands at the bloody dust; or as</p>
	<p id="IL.16.487">a blazing and haughty bull in a huddle of shambling cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.16.488">when a lion has come among the herd and destroys him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.489">dies bellowing under the hooked claws of the lion, so now</p>
	<p id="IL.16.490">before Patroklos the lord of the shield-armoured Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.491">died raging, and called aloud to his beloved companion:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.492">'Dear Glaukos, you are a fighter among men. Now the need comes</p>
	<p id="IL.16.493">hardest upon you to be a spearman and a bold warrior.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.494">Now, if you are brave, let bitter warfare be dear to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.495">First you must go among all men who are lords of the Lykians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.496">everywhere, and stir them up to fight for Sarpedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.497">and then you yourself also must fight for me with the bronze spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.498">For I shall be a thing of shame and a reproach said of you</p>
	<p id="IL.16.499">afterwards, all your days forever, if the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.500">strip my armour here where I fell by the ships assembled.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.501">But hold strongly on and stir up all the rest of our people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.502">He spoke, and as he spoke death's end closed over his nostrils</p>
	<p id="IL.16.503">and eyes, and Patroklos stepping heel braced to chest dragged</p>
	<p id="IL.16.504">the spear out of his body, and the midriff came away with it</p>
	<p id="IL.16.505">so that he drew out with the spearhead the life of Sarpedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.506">and the Myrmidons close by held in the hard-breathing horses</p>
	<p id="IL.16.507">as they tried to bolt away, once free of their master's chariot.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.508">But when he heard the voice a hard sorrow came upon Glaukos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.509">and the heart was stirred within him, and he could not defend Sarpedon.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.510">He took his arm in his hand and squeezed it, since the wound hurt him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.511">where Teukros had hit him with an arrow shot as he swept in</p>
	<p id="IL.16.512">on the high wall, and fended destruction from his companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.513">He spoke in prayer to him who strikes from afar, Apollo:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.514">'Hear me, my lord. You are somewhere in the rich Lykian countryside</p>
	<p id="IL.16.515">or here in Troy, and wherever you are you can listen</p>
	<p id="IL.16.516">to a man in pain, as now this pain has descended upon me.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.517">For see, I have this strong wound on me, and my arm on both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.16.518">is driven with sharp pains about, my blood is not able</p>
	<p id="IL.16.519">to dry and stop running, my shoulder is aching beneath it.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.520">I cannot hold my spear up steady, I cannot go forward</p>
	<p id="IL.16.521">to fight against the enemy. And the best of men has perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.522">Sarpedon, son of Zeus; who will not stand by his children.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.523">No, but you at least, my lord, make well this strong wound;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.524">and put the pains to sleep, give me strength, so that I may call out</p>
	<p id="IL.16.525">to my companions, the Lykians, and stir them to fight on,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.526">and I myself do battle over the fallen body.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.527">So he spoke in prayer, and Phoibos Apollo heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.528">At once he made the pains stop, and dried away from the hard wound</p>
	<p id="IL.16.529">the dark running of blood, and put strength into his spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.530">And Glaukos knew in his heart what was done, and was happy</p>
	<p id="IL.16.531">that the great god had listened to his prayer. And first of all</p>
	<p id="IL.16.532">he roused toward battle all the men who were lords of the Lykians,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.533">going everywhere among them, to fight for Sarpedon;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.534">afterwards he ranged in long strides among the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.535">by Poulydamas the son of Panthoös and brilliant Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.536">and went to Aineias and to Hektor of the brazen helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.537">and stood near them and addressed them in winged words: 'Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.538">now you have utterly forgotten your armed companions</p>
	<p id="IL.16.539">who for your sake, far from their friends and the land of their fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.540">are wearing their lives away, and you will do nothing to help them.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.541">Sarpedon has fallen, the lord of the shield-armoured Lykians,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.542">who defended Lykia in his strength and the right of his justice.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.543">Now brazen Ares has struck him down by the spear of Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.544">Then, friends, stand beside me, let the thought be shame in your spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.16.545">that they might strip away his arms, and dishonour his body,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.546">these Myrmidons, in anger for all the Danaans perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.547">those whom we Lykians have killed with the spear by the swift ships.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.548">He spoke, and the Trojans were taken head to heel with a sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.16.549">untakeable, not to be endured, since he was their city's</p>
	<p id="IL.16.550">stay, always, though he was an outlander, and many people</p>
	<p id="IL.16.551">came with him, but he was the best of them all in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.16.552">always. They went straight for the Danaans, raging, and Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.553">led them, in anger for Sarpedon. Meanwhile the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.554">roused to the savage heart of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.555">First he spoke to the Aiantes, who were burning for battle already:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.556">'Aiantes, now your desire must be to defend yourselves, and be</p>
	<p id="IL.16.557">such as you were among men before, or even more valiant.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.558">The man is fallen who first scaled the wall of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.559">Sarpedon. If only we could win and dishonour his body</p>
	<p id="IL.16.560">and strip the armour from his shoulders, and kill with the pitiless</p>
	<p id="IL.16.561">bronze some one of his companions who fight to defend him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.562">He spoke, and they likewise grew furious in their defence,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.563">and when they on either side had made massive their battalions,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.564">Trojans and Lykians, and Myrmidons and Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.565">they clashed together in battle over the perished body</p>
	<p id="IL.16.566">howling terribly, with a high crash of the men in their armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.567">while Zeus swept ghastly night far over the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.16.568">that over his dear son might be deadly work in the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.569">First the Trojans shouldered back the glancing-eyed Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.570">when a man, and not the worst of the Myrmidons, was struck down,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.571">son of high-hearted Agakles, Epeigeus the brilliant.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.572">He was one who was lord before in strong-founded Boudeion,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.573">but now, since he had happened to kill his high-born cousin,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.574">had come suppliant to Peleus and to Thetis the silver-footed,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.575">and these sent him to follow Achilleus, who broke men in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.576">to Ilion of the horses and the battle against the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.577">As he caught at a dead man glorious Hektor hit him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.578">with a stone in the head, and all the head broke into two pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.16.579">inside the heavy helmet, and he in the dust face downward</p>
	<p id="IL.16.580">dropped, while death breaking the spirit drifted about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.581">And the sorrow took hold of Patroklos for his fallen companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.582">He steered his way through the ranks of the front fighters, like a flying</p>
	<p id="IL.16.583">hawk who scatters into flight the daws and the starlings.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.584">So straight for the Lykians, o lord of horses, Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.585">you swept, and for the Trojans, heart angered for your companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.586">Now he struck Sthenelaos, beloved son of Ithaimenes,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.587">in the neck with a stone, and broke the tendons loose from about it.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.588">The champions of Troy gave back then, and glorious Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.589">As far as goes the driving cast of a slender javelin</p>
	<p id="IL.16.590">which a man throws making trial of his strength, either in a contest</p>
	<p id="IL.16.591">or else in battle, under the heart-breaking hostilities,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.592">so far the Trojans gave way with the Achaians pushing them.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.593">But Glaukos was first, lord of the shield-armoured Lykians,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.594">to turn again, and killed Bathykles the great-hearted, beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.16.595">son of Chalkon, who had dwelled in his home in Hellas</p>
	<p id="IL.16.596">conspicuous for wealth and success among all the Myrmidons.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.597">It was he whom Glaukos stabbed in the middle of the chest, turning</p>
	<p id="IL.16.598">suddenly back with his spear as he overtook him. He fell,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.599">thunderously, and the closing sorrow came over the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.600">as the great man went down, but the Trojans were gladdened greatly</p>
	<p id="IL.16.601">and came and stood in a pack about him, nor did the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.16.602">let go of their fighting strength, but steered their fury straight at them.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.603">And there Meriones cut down a chief man of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.604">Laogonos, bold son of Onetor, who was Idaian,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.605">Zeus' priest, and who was honoured in his countryside as a god is.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.606">Meriones struck him by jaw and ear, and at once the life spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.16.607">fled from his limbs, and the hateful darkness closed in about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.608">But Aineias threw his bronze spear at Meriones, hoping</p>
	<p id="IL.16.609">to hit him as he came forward under his shield's covering,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.610">but Meriones with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.611">For he bent forward, and behind his back the long spearshaft</p>
	<p id="IL.16.612">was driven into the ground so that the butt end was shaken</p>
	<p id="IL.16.613">on the spear. Then and there Ares the huge took the force from it</p>
	<p id="IL.16.614">[so that the vibrant shaft of Aineias was driven groundward</p>
	<p id="IL.16.615">since it had been thrown in a vain cast from his big hand].</p>
	<p id="IL.16.616">But Aineias was angered in his spirit, and called out to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.617">'Meriones, though you are a dancer my spear might have stopped you</p>
	<p id="IL.16.618">now and for all time, if only I could have hit you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.619">Then in turn Meriones the spear-famed answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.620">'Aineias, strong fighter though you are, it would be hard for you</p>
	<p id="IL.16.621">to quench the strength of every man who might come against you</p>
	<p id="IL.16.622">and defend himself, since you also are made as a mortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.623">But if I could throw and hit you with the sharp bronze in the middle,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.624">then strong as you are and confident in your hands' work, you might</p>
	<p id="IL.16.625">give the glory to me, and your soul to Hades of the horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.626">He spoke, but the fighting son of Menoitios reprimanded him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.627">'Meriones, when you are a brave fighter, why say such things?--</p>
	<p id="IL.16.628">See, dear friend, the Trojans will not give back from the body</p>
	<p id="IL.16.629">for hard words spoken. Sooner the ground will cover them. Warfare's</p>
	<p id="IL.16.630">finality lies in the work of hands, that of words in counsel.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.631">It is not for us now to pile up talk, but to fight in battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.632">He spoke, and led the way, and the other followed, a mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.16.633">like a god. As the tumult goes up from men who are cutting</p>
	<p id="IL.16.634">timber in the mountain valleys, and the sound is heard from far off,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.635">such was the dull crashing that rose from earth of the wide ways,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.636">from the bronze shields, the skins and the strong-covering ox-hides</p>
	<p id="IL.16.637">as the swords and leaf-headed spears stabbed against them. No longer</p>
	<p id="IL.16.638">could a man, even a knowing one, have made out the godlike</p>
	<p id="IL.16.639">Sarpedon, since he was piled from head to ends of feet under</p>
	<p id="IL.16.640">a mass of weapons, the blood and the dust, while others about him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.641">kept forever swarming over his dead body, as flies</p>
	<p id="IL.16.642">through a sheepfold thunder about the pails overspilling</p>
	<p id="IL.16.643">milk, in the season of spring when the milk splashes in the buckets.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.644">So they swarmed over the dead man, nor did Zeus ever</p>
	<p id="IL.16.645">turn the glaring of his eyes from the strong encounter,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.646">but kept gazing forever upon them, in spirit reflective,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.647">and pondered hard over many ways for the death of Patroklos;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.648">whether this was now the time, in this strong encounter,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.649">when there over godlike Sarpedon glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.650">should kill him with the bronze, and strip the armour away from his shoulders,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.651">or whether to increase the steep work of fighting for more men.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.652">In the division of his heart this way seemed best to him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.653">for the strong henchman of Achilleus, the son of Peleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.654">once again to push the Trojans and bronze-helmed Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.655">back on their city, and tear the life from many. In Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.656">first of all he put a temper that was without strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.657">He climbed to his chariot and turned to flight, and called to the other</p>
	<p id="IL.16.658">Trojans to run, for he saw the way of Zeus' sacred balance.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.659">Nor did the powerful Lykians stand now, but were all scattered</p>
	<p id="IL.16.660">to flight, when they had seen their king with a spear in his heart, lying</p>
	<p id="IL.16.661">under the pile of dead men, since many others had fallen</p>
	<p id="IL.16.662">above him, once Zeus had strained fast the powerful conflict.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.663">But the Achaians took from Sarpedon's shoulders the armour</p>
	<p id="IL.16.664">glaring and brazen, and this the warlike son of Menoitios</p>
	<p id="IL.16.665">gave to his companions to carry back to the hollow ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.666">And now Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke a word to Apollo:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.667">'Go if you will, beloved Phoibos, and rescue Sarpedon</p>
	<p id="IL.16.668">from under the weapons, wash the dark suffusion of blood from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.669">then carry him far away and wash him in a running river,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.670">anoint him in ambrosia, put ambrosial clothing upon him;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.671">then give him into the charge of swift messengers to carry him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.672">of Sleep and Death, who are twin brothers, and these two shall lay him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.673">down presently within the rich countryside of broad Lykia</p>
	<p id="IL.16.674">where his brothers and countrymen shall give him due burial</p>
	<p id="IL.16.675">with tomb and gravestone. Such is the privilege of those who have perished.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.676">He spoke so, and Apollo, not disregarding his father,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.677">went down along the mountains of Ida, into the grim fight,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.678">and lifting brilliant Sarpedon out from under the weapons</p>
	<p id="IL.16.679">carried him far away, and washed him in a running river,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.680">and anointed him in ambrosia, put ambrosial clothing upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.681">then gave him into the charge of swift messengers to carry him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.682">of Sleep and Death, who are twin brothers, and these two presently</p>
	<p id="IL.16.683">laid him down within the rich countryside of broad Lykia.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.684">But Patroklos, with a shout to Automedon and his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.685">went after Trojans and Lykians in a huge blind fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.686">Besotted: had he only kept the command of Peleiades</p>
	<p id="IL.16.687">he might have got clear away from the evil spirit of black death.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.688">But always the mind of Zeus is a stronger thing than a man's mind.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.689">He terrifies even the warlike man, he takes away victory</p>
	<p id="IL.16.690">lightly, when he himself has driven a man into battle</p>
	<p id="IL.16.691">as now he drove on the fury in the heart of Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.692">Then who was it you slaughtered first, who was the last one,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.693">Patroklos, as the gods called you to your death? Adrestos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.694">first, and after him Autonoös and Echeklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.695">Perimos, son of Megas, and Epistor, and Melanippos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.696">and after these Elasos, and Moulios, and Pylartes.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.697">These he killed, while each man of the rest was bent on escaping.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.698">There the sons of the Achaians might have taken gate-towering Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.16.699">under the hands of Patroklos, who raged with the spear far before them,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.700">had not Phoibos Apollo taken his stand on the strong-built</p>
	<p id="IL.16.701">tower, with thoughts of death for him, but help for the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.702">Three times Patroklos tried to mount the angle of the towering</p>
	<p id="IL.16.703">wall, and three times Phoibos Apollo battered him backward</p>
	<p id="IL.16.704">with the immortal hands beating back the bright shield. As Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.705">for the fourth time, like something more than a man, came at him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.706">he called aloud, and spoke winged words in the voice of danger:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.707">'Give way, illustrious Patroklos: it is not destined</p>
	<p id="IL.16.708">that the city of the proud Trojans shall fall before your spear</p>
	<p id="IL.16.709">nor even at the hand of Achilleus, who is far better than you are.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.710">He spoke, and Patroklos gave ground before him a great way,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.711">avoiding the anger of him who strikes from afar, Apollo.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.712">But Hektor inside the Skaian Gates held his single-foot horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.713">and wondered whether to drive back into the carnage, and fight there,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.714">or call aloud to his people to rally inside the wall. Thus</p>
	<p id="IL.16.715">as he was pondering Phoibos Apollo came and stood by him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.716">assuming the likeness of a man, a young and a strong one,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.717">Asios, who was uncle to Hektor, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.718">since he was brother of Hekabe, and the son of Dymas,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.719">and had made his home in Phrygia by the stream of Sangarios.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.720">In the likeness of this man Zeus' son Apollo spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.721">'Hektor, why have you stopped fighting? You should not do it.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.722">If I were as much stronger than you as now I am weaker!</p>
	<p id="IL.16.723">So might you, in this evil way, hold back from the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.724">But come! Hold straight against Patroklos your strong-footed horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.725">You might be able to kill him. Apollo might give you such glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.726">He spoke, and went once more, a divinity, into the mortals'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.727">struggle, while glorious Hektor called to wise Kebriones</p>
	<p id="IL.16.728">to lash their horses into the fighting. Meanwhile Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.16.729">went down into the battle, and launched a deadly confusion</p>
	<p id="IL.16.730">upon the Argives, and gave glory to the Trojans and Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.731">Now Hektor let the rest of the Danaans be, and he would not</p>
	<p id="IL.16.732">kill them, but drove his strong-footed horses straight for Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.733">On the other side Patroklos sprang to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.16.734">holding his spear in his left hand. In the other he caught up</p>
	<p id="IL.16.735">a stone, jagged and shining, in the hold of his hand, and threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.736">leaning into the throw, nor fell short of the man he aimed at</p>
	<p id="IL.16.737">nor threw vainly, but hit the charioteer of Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.738">Kebriones, a bastard son of glorious Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.739">as he held the reins on his horses. The sharp stone hit him in the forehead</p>
	<p id="IL.16.740">and smashed both brows in on each other, nor could the bone hold</p>
	<p id="IL.16.741">the rock, but his eyes fell out into the dust before him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.742">there at his feet, so that he vaulted to earth like a diver</p>
	<p id="IL.16.743">from the carefully wrought chariot, and the life left his bones. Now</p>
	<p id="IL.16.744">you spoke in bitter mockery over him, rider Patroklos:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.745">'See now, what a light man this is, how agile an acrobat.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.746">If only he were somewhere on the sea, where the fish swarm,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.747">he could fill the hunger of many men, by diving for oysters;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.748">he could go overboard from a boat even in rough weather</p>
	<p id="IL.16.749">the way he somersaults so light to the ground from his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.16.750">now. So, to be sure, in Troy also they have their acrobats.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.751">He spoke so, and strode against the hero Kebriones</p>
	<p id="IL.16.752">with the spring of a lion, who as he ravages the pastures</p>
	<p id="IL.16.753">has been hit in the chest, and his own courage destroys him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.754">So in your fury you pounced, Patroklos, above Kebriones.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.755">On the other side Hektor sprang to the ground from his chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.756">and the two fought it out over Kebriones, like lions</p>
	<p id="IL.16.757">who in the high places of a mountain, both in huge courage</p>
	<p id="IL.16.758">and both hungry, fight together over a killed deer.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.759">So above Kebriones these two, urgent for battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.760">Patroklos, son of Menoitios, and glorious Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.761">were straining with the pitiless bronze to tear at each other;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.762">since Hektor had caught him by the head, and would not let go of him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.763">and Patroklos had his foot on the other side, while the other</p>
	<p id="IL.16.764">Trojans and Danaans drove together the strength of their onset.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.765">As east wind and south wind fight it out with each other</p>
	<p id="IL.16.766">in the valleys of the mountains to shake the deep forest timber,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.767">oak tree and ash and the cornel with the delicate bark; these</p>
	<p id="IL.16.768">whip their wide-reaching branches against one another</p>
	<p id="IL.16.769">in inhuman noise, and the crash goes up from the splintering timber;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.770">so Trojans and Achaians springing against one another</p>
	<p id="IL.16.771">cut men down, nor did either side think of disastrous panic,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.772">and many sharp spears were driven home about Kebriones</p>
	<p id="IL.16.773">and many feathered arrows sprung from the bowstrings, many</p>
	<p id="IL.16.774">great throwing stones pounded against the shields, as they fought on</p>
	<p id="IL.16.775">hard over his body, as he in the turning dust lay</p>
	<p id="IL.16.776">mightily in his might, his horsemanship all forgotten.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.777">So long as the sun was climbing still to the middle heaven,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.778">so long the thrown weapons of both took hold, and men dropped under them;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.779">but when the sun had gone to the time for unyoking of cattle,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.780">then beyond their very destiny the Achaians were stronger</p>
	<p id="IL.16.781">and dragged the hero Kebriones from under the weapons</p>
	<p id="IL.16.782">and the clamour of the Trojans, and stripped the armour from his shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.783">And Patroklos charged with evil intention in on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.784">Three times he charged in with the force of the running war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.785">screaming a terrible cry, and three times he cut down nine men;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.786">but as for the fourth time he swept in, like something greater</p>
	<p id="IL.16.787">than human, there, Patroklos, the end of your life was shown forth,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.788">since Phoibos came against you there in the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.16.789">dangerously, nor did Patroklos see him as he moved through</p>
	<p id="IL.16.790">the battle, and shrouded in a deep mist came in against him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.791">and stood behind him, and struck his back and his broad shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.16.792">with a flat stroke of the hand so that his eyes spun. Phoibos</p>
	<p id="IL.16.793">Apollo now struck away from his head the helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.16.794">four-horned and hollow-eyed, and under the feet of the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.16.795">it rolled clattering, and the plumes above it were defiled</p>
	<p id="IL.16.796">by blood and dust. Before this time it had not been permitted</p>
	<p id="IL.16.797">to defile in the dust this great helmet crested in horse-hair;</p>
	<p id="IL.16.798">rather it guarded the head and the gracious brow of a godlike</p>
	<p id="IL.16.799">man, Achilleus; but now Zeus gave it over to Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.800">to wear on his head, Hektor whose own death was close to him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.801">And in his hands was splintered all the huge, great, heavy,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.802">iron-shod, far-shadowing spear, and away from his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.16.803">dropped to the ground the shield with its shield sling and its tassels.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.804">The lord Apollo, son of Zeus, broke the corselet upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.805">Disaster caught his wits, and his shining body went nerveless.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.806">He stood stupidly, and from close behind his back a Dardanian</p>
	<p id="IL.16.807">man hit him between the shoulders with a sharp javelin:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.808">Euphorbos, son of Panthoös, who surpassed all men of his own age</p>
	<p id="IL.16.809">with the throwing spear, and in horsemanship and the speed of his feet. He</p>
	<p id="IL.16.810">had already brought down twenty men from their horses</p>
	<p id="IL.16.811">since first coming, with his chariot and his learning in warfare.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.812">He first hit you with a thrown spear, o rider Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.813">nor broke you, but ran away again, snatching out the ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.16.814">from your body, and lost himself in the crowd, not enduring</p>
	<p id="IL.16.815">to face Patroklos, naked as he was, in close combat.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.816">Now Patroklos, broken by the spear and the god's blow, tried</p>
	<p id="IL.16.817">to shun death and shrink back into the swarm of his own companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.818">But Hektor, when he saw high-hearted Patroklos trying</p>
	<p id="IL.16.819">to get away, saw how he was wounded with the sharp javelin,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.820">came close against him across the ranks, and with the spear stabbed him</p>
	<p id="IL.16.821">in the depth of the belly and drove the bronze clean through. He fell,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.822">thunderously, to the horror of all the Achaian people.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.823">As a lion overpowers a weariless boar in wild combat</p>
	<p id="IL.16.824">as the two fight in their pride on the high places of a mountain</p>
	<p id="IL.16.825">over a little spring of water, both wanting to drink there,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.826">and the lion beats him down by force as he fights for his breath, so</p>
	<p id="IL.16.827">Hektor, Priam's son, with a close spear-stroke stripped the life</p>
	<p id="IL.16.828">from the fighting son of Menoitios, who had killed so many,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.829">and stood above him, and spoke aloud the winged words of triumph:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.830">'Patroklos, you thought perhaps of devastating our city,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.831">of stripping from the Trojan women the day of their liberty</p>
	<p id="IL.16.832">and dragging them off in ships to the beloved land of your fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.833">Fool! When in front of them the running horses of Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.16.834">strained with their swift feet into the fighting, and I with my own spear</p>
	<p id="IL.16.835">am conspicuous among the fighting Trojans, I who beat from them</p>
	<p id="IL.16.836">the day of necessity. For you, here the vultures shall eat you.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.837">Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.838">When he stayed behind, and you went, he must have said much to you:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.839">"Patroklos, lord of horses, see that you do not come back to me</p>
	<p id="IL.16.840">and the hollow ships, until you have torn in blood the tunic</p>
	<p id="IL.16.841">of manslaughtering Hektor about his chest." In some such</p>
	<p id="IL.16.842">manner he spoke to you, and persuaded the fool's heart in you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.843">And now, dying, you answered him, o rider Patroklos:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.844">'Now is your time for big words, Hektor. Yours is the victory</p>
	<p id="IL.16.845">given by Kronos' son, Zeus, and Apollo, who have subdued me</p>
	<p id="IL.16.846">easily, since they themselves stripped the arms from my shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.847">Even though twenty such as you had come in against me,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.848">they would all have been broken beneath my spear, and have perished.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.849">No, deadly destiny, with the son of Leto, has killed me,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.850">and of men it was Euphorbos; you are only my third slayer.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.851">And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.852">You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already</p>
	<p id="IL.16.853">death and powerful destiny are standing beside you,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.854">to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.855">He spoke, and as he spoke the end of death closed in upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.856">and the soul fluttering free of his limbs went down into Death's house</p>
	<p id="IL.16.857">mourning her destiny, leaving youth and manhood behind her.</p>
	<p id="IL.16.858">Now though he was a dead man glorious Hektor spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.16.859">'Patroklos, what is this prophecy of my headlong destruction?</p>
	<p id="IL.16.860">Who knows if even Achilleus, son of lovely-haired Thetis,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.861">might before this be struck by my spear, and his own life perish?'</p>
	<p id="IL.16.862">He spoke, and setting his heel upon him wrenched out the bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.16.863">from the wound, then spurned him away on his back from the spear. Thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.16.864">armed with the spear he went on, aiming a cast at Automedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.865">the godlike henchman for the swift-footed son of Aiakos,</p>
	<p id="IL.16.866">with the spear as he was carried away by those swift and immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.16.867">horses the gods had given as shining gifts to Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.1">As Patroklos went down before the Trojans in the hard fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.2">he was not unseen by Atreus' son, warlike Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.3">who stalked through the ranks of the champions, helmed in the bright bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.4">and bestrode the body, as over a first-born calf the mother</p>
	<p id="IL.17.5">cow stands lowing, she who has known no children before this.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.6">So Menelaos of the fair hair stood over Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.7">and held the spear and the perfect circle of his shield before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.8">raging to cut down any man who might come forth against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.9">Nor did the fall of blameless Patroklos pass unattended</p>
	<p id="IL.17.10">by Panthoös' son of the strong ash spear, Euphorbos, who standing</p>
	<p id="IL.17.11">close to face him spoke a word to warlike Menelaos:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.12">'Son of Atreus, Menelaos, illustrious, leader of armies:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.13">give way, let the bloody spoils be, get back from this body,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.14">since before me no one of the Trojans, or renowned companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.15">struck Patroklos down with the spear in the strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.16">Thereby let me win this great glory among the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.17">before I hit you and strip the sweetness of life away from you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.18">Deeply stirred, Menelaos of the fair hair answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.19">'Father Zeus, it is not well for the proud man to glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.20">Neither the fury of the leopard is such, not such is the lion's,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.21">nor the fury of the devastating wild boar, within whose breast</p>
	<p id="IL.17.22">the spirit is biggest and vaunts in the pride of his strength, is so great</p>
	<p id="IL.17.23">as goes the pride in these sons of Panthoös of the strong ash spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.24">Yet even the strength of Hyperenor, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.25">had no joy of his youth when he stood against me and taunted me</p>
	<p id="IL.17.26">and said that among all the Danaans I was the weakest</p>
	<p id="IL.17.27">in battle. Yet I think that his feet shall no more carry him</p>
	<p id="IL.17.28">back, to pleasure his beloved wife and his honoured parents.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.29">So I think I can break your strength as well, if you only</p>
	<p id="IL.17.30">stand against me. No, but I myself tell you to get back</p>
	<p id="IL.17.31">into the multitude, not stand to face me, before you</p>
	<p id="IL.17.32">take some harm. Once a thing has been done, the fool sees it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.33">He spoke so, but did not persuade Euphorbos, who answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.34">'Then, lordly Menelaos, you must now pay the penalty</p>
	<p id="IL.17.35">for my brother, whom you killed, and boast that you did it,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.36">and made his wife a widow in the depth of a young bride chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.17.37">and left to his parents the curse of lamentation and sorrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.38">Yet I might stop the mourning of these unhappy people</p>
	<p id="IL.17.39">if I could carry back to them your head, and your armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.40">and toss them into Panthoös' hands, and to Phrontis the lovely.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.41">No, this struggle shall not go long untested between us</p>
	<p id="IL.17.42">nor yet unfought, whether it prove our strength or our terror.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.43">He spoke, and stabbed Menelaos' shield in its perfect circle,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.44">nor did the bronze break its way through, but the spearhead bent back</p>
	<p id="IL.17.45">in the strong shield. And after him Atreus' son, Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.46">made his prayer to father Zeus and lunged with the bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.17.47">and as he was drawing back caught him in the pit of the gullet</p>
	<p id="IL.17.48">and leaned in on the stroke in the confidence of his strong hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.49">and clean through the soft part of the neck the spearpoint was driven.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.50">He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.51">and his hair, lovely as the Graces, was splattered with blood, those</p>
	<p id="IL.17.52">braided locks caught waspwise in gold and silver. As some</p>
	<p id="IL.17.53">slip of an olive tree strong-growing that a man raises</p>
	<p id="IL.17.54">in a lonely place, and drenched it with generous water, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.17.55">it blossoms into beauty, and the blasts of winds from all quarters</p>
	<p id="IL.17.56">tremble it, and it bursts into pale blossoming. But then</p>
	<p id="IL.17.57">a wind suddenly in a great tempest descending upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.58">wrenches it out of its stand and lays it at length on the ground; such</p>
	<p id="IL.17.59">was Euphorbos of the strong ash spear, the son of Panthoös,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.60">whom Menelaos Atreides killed, and was stripping his armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.61">As when in the confidence of his strength some lion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.62">hill-reared snatches the finest cow in a herd as it pastures;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.63">first the lion breaks her neck caught fast in the strong teeth,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.64">then gulps down the blood and all the guts that are inward</p>
	<p id="IL.17.65">savagely, as the dogs and the herdsmen raise a commotion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.66">loudly about him, but from a distance, and are not willing</p>
	<p id="IL.17.67">to go in and face him, since the hard green fear has hold of them;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.68">so no heart in the breast of any Trojan had courage</p>
	<p id="IL.17.69">to go in and face glorious Menelaos. Then easily</p>
	<p id="IL.17.70">the son of Atreus might have taken the glorious armour</p>
	<p id="IL.17.71">from Panthoös' son, only Phoibos Apollo begrudged him</p>
	<p id="IL.17.72">and stirred up Hektor, a match for the running war god, against him</p>
	<p id="IL.17.73">in semblance of a man, the leader of the Kikones,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.74">Mentes, and spoke aloud to him, and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.75">'While you, Hektor, run after what can never be captured,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.76">the horses of valiant Aiakides; they are difficult horses</p>
	<p id="IL.17.77">for mortal man to manage, or even to ride behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.78">for all except Achilleus, who was born of an immortal mother;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.79">meanwhile Menelaos, the warlike son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.80">stands over Patroklos and has killed the best man of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.81">Euphorbos, Panthoös' son, and stopped his furious valour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.82">So he spoke, and went back, a god, to the mortals' struggle.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.83">But bitter sorrow closed over Hektor's heart in its darkness.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.84">He looked about then across the ranks, and at once was aware</p>
	<p id="IL.17.85">of the two men, one stripping the glorious armour, the other</p>
	<p id="IL.17.86">sprawled on the ground, and blood running from the gash of the spear-thrust.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.87">He stalked through the ranks of the champions helmed in the bright bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.17.88">with a shrill scream, and looking like the flame of Hephaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.89">weariless. Nor did Atreus' son fail to hear the sharp cry.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.90">Deeply troubled, he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.91">'Ah me; if I abandon here the magnificent armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.92">and Patroklos, who has fallen here for the sake of my honour,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.93">shall not some one of the Danaans, seeing it, hold it against me?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.94">Yet if I fight, alone as I am, the Trojans and Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.17.95">for shame, shall they not close in, many against one, about me?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.96">Hektor of the shining helm leads all of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.97">here. Then why does my own heart within me debate this?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.98">When a man, in the face of divinity, would fight with another</p>
	<p id="IL.17.99">whom some god honours, the big disaster rolls sudden upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.100">Therefore, let no Danaan seeing it hold it against me</p>
	<p id="IL.17.101">if I give way before Hektor, who fights from God. Yet if somewhere</p>
	<p id="IL.17.102">I could only get some word of Aias of the great war cry,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.103">we two might somehow go, and keep our spirit of battle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.104">even in the face of divinity, if we might win the body</p>
	<p id="IL.17.105">for Peleïd Achilleus. It would be our best among evils.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.106">Now as he was pondering this in his heart and his spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.17.107">meanwhile the ranks of the Trojans came on, and Hektor led them;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.108">and Menelaos backed away from them and left the dead man,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.109">but kept turning on his way like some great bearded lion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.110">when dogs and men drive him off from a steading with weapons</p>
	<p id="IL.17.111">and shouts, and in the breast of the lion the strong heart of valour</p>
	<p id="IL.17.112">freezes, and he goes reluctant away from the fenced ground.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.113">So fair-haired Menelaos moved from Patroklos, but turning</p>
	<p id="IL.17.114">stood fast when he had got back to the swarm of his own companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.115">and looked all about for huge Aias, the son of Telamon,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.116">and saw soon where he was, at the left of the entire battle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.117">encouraging his companions and urging them into the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.118">since Phoibos Apollo had smitten them all with unearthly terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.119">He went on the run, and presently stood beside him and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.120">'This way, Aias, we must make for fallen Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.121">to try if we can carry back to Achilleus the body</p>
	<p id="IL.17.122">which is naked; Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.123">So he spoke, and stirred the spirit in valiant Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.17.124">who strode among the champions, fair-haired Menelaos with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.125">But Hektor, when he had stripped from Patroklos the glorious armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.126">dragged at him, meaning to cut his head from his shoulders with the sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.127">to haul off the body and give it to the dogs of Troy; but meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.17.128">Aias came near him, carrying like a wall his shield,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.129">and Hektor drew back to the company of his own companions</p>
	<p id="IL.17.130">and sprang to his chariot, but handed over the beautiful armour</p>
	<p id="IL.17.131">to the Trojans, to take back to the city and to be his great glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.132">Now Aias covering the son of Menoitios under his broad shield</p>
	<p id="IL.17.133">stood fast, like a lion over his young, when the lion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.134">is leading his little ones along, and men who are hunting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.135">come upon them in the forest. He stands in the pride of his great strength</p>
	<p id="IL.17.136">hooding his eyes under the cover of down-drawn eyelids.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.137">Such was Aias as he bestrode the hero Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.138">while on the other side Atreus' son, warlike Menelaos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.139">stood fast, feeding still bigger the great sorrow within him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.140">But Glaukos, lord of the Lykian men, the son of Hippolochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.141">looked at Hektor, scowling, and laid a harsh word upon him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.142">'Hektor, splendid to look at, you come far short in your fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.143">That fame of yours, high as it is, belongs to a runner.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.144">Take thought now how to hold fast your town, your citadel</p>
	<p id="IL.17.145">by yourself, with those your people who were born in Ilion;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.146">since no Lykian will go forth now to fight with the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.147">for the sake of your city, since after all we got no gratitude</p>
	<p id="IL.17.148">for our everlasting hard struggle against your enemies.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.149">How then, o hard-hearted, shall you save a worse man in all your</p>
	<p id="IL.17.150">company, when you have abandoned Sarpedon, your guest-friend</p>
	<p id="IL.17.151">and own companion, to be the spoil and prey of the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.152">who was of so much use to you, yourself and your city</p>
	<p id="IL.17.153">while he lived? Now you have not the spirit to keep the dogs from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.154">Therefore now, if any of the Lykian men will obey me,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.155">we are going home, and the headlong destruction of Troy shall be manifest.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.156">For if the Trojans had any fighting strength that were daring</p>
	<p id="IL.17.157">and unshaken, such as comes on men who, for the sake of their country,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.158">have made the hard hateful work come between them and their enemies,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.159">we could quickly get the body of Patroklos inside Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.160">If, dead man though he be, he could be brought into the great city</p>
	<p id="IL.17.161">of lord Priam, if we could tear him out of the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.162">the Argives must at once give up the beautiful armour</p>
	<p id="IL.17.163">of Sarpedon, and we could carry his body inside Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.164">Such is the man whose henchman is killed. He is far the greatest</p>
	<p id="IL.17.165">of the Argives by the ships, and his men fight hard at close quarters.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.166">No, but you could not bring yourself to stand up against Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.17.167">of the great heart, nor to look at his eyes in the clamour of fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.168">men, nor attack him direct, since he is far better than you are.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.169">Looking darkly at him tall Hektor of the shining helm answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.170">'Glaukos, why did a man like you speak this word of annoyance?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.171">I am surprised. I thought that for wits you surpassed all others</p>
	<p id="IL.17.172">of those who dwell in Lykia where the soil is generous; and yet</p>
	<p id="IL.17.173">now I utterly despise your heart for the thing you have spoken</p>
	<p id="IL.17.174">when you said I cannot stand in the face of gigantic Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.175">I am not one who shudders at attack and the thunder of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.176">But always the mind of Zeus is a stronger thing than a man's mind.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.177">He terrifies even the warlike man, he takes away victory</p>
	<p id="IL.17.178">lightly, when he himself has driven a man into battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.179">Come here, friend, and watch me at work; learn, standing beside me,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.180">whether I shall be a coward all day, as you proclaim me,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.181">or whether I stop some Danaan, for all of his fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.182">from his fighting strength and from the defence of fallen Patroklos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.183">So speaking he called afar in a great voice to the Trojans:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.184">'Trojans, Lykians, Dardanians who fight at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.185">be men now, dear friends, remember your furious valour</p>
	<p id="IL.17.186">while I am putting on the beautiful armour of blameless</p>
	<p id="IL.17.187">Achilleus, which I stripped from Patroklos the strong when I killed him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.188">So spoke Hektor of the shining helm, and departed</p>
	<p id="IL.17.189">from the hateful battle, and running caught up with his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.17.190">very soon, since he went on quick feet, and they had not gone far</p>
	<p id="IL.17.191">carrying the glorious armour of Peleus' son toward the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.192">He stood apart from the sorrowful fighting, and changed his armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.193">and gave what he had worn to the fighting Trojans to carry</p>
	<p id="IL.17.194">to sacred Ilion, and himself put on that armour immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.17.195">of Peleïd Achilleus, which the Uranian gods had given</p>
	<p id="IL.17.196">to his loved father; and he in turn grown old had given it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.197">to his son; but a son who never grew old in his father's armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.198">When Zeus who gathers the clouds saw him, apart from the others</p>
	<p id="IL.17.199">arming himself in the battle gear of godlike Peleïdes,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.200">he stirred his head and spoke to his own spirit: 'Ah, poor wretch!</p>
	<p id="IL.17.201">There is no thought of death in your mind now, and yet death stands</p>
	<p id="IL.17.202">close beside you as you put on the immortal armour</p>
	<p id="IL.17.203">of a surpassing man. There are others who tremble before him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.204">Now you have killed this man's dear friend, who was strong and gentle,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.205">and taken the armour, as you should not have done, from his shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.17.206">and head. Still for the present I will invest you with great strength</p>
	<p id="IL.17.207">to make up for it that you will not come home out of the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.208">nor Andromache take from your hands the glorious arms of Achilleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.209">He spoke, the son of Kronos, and nodded his head with the dark brows.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.210">The armour was fitted to Hektor's skin, and Ares the dangerous</p>
	<p id="IL.17.211">war god entered him, so that the inward body was packed full</p>
	<p id="IL.17.212">of force and fighting strength. He went onward calling in a great voice</p>
	<p id="IL.17.213">to his renowned companions in arms, and figured before them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.214">flaming in the battle gear of great-hearted Peleion.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.215">He ranged their ranks, and spoke a word to encourage each captain,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.216">to Mesthles and Glaukos, to Thersilochos and Medon,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.217">Deisenor and Hippothoös and Asteropaios,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.218">to Phorkys and Chromios and the bird interpreter Ennomos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.219">and stirring all of these forward called to them in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.220">'Hear me, you numberless hordes of companions who live at our borders.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.221">It was not for any desire nor need of a multitude</p>
	<p id="IL.17.222">that man by man I gathered you to come here from your cities,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.223">but so that you might have good will to defend the innocent</p>
	<p id="IL.17.224">children of the Trojans, and their wives, from the fighting Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.225">With such a purpose I wear out my own people for presents</p>
	<p id="IL.17.226">and food, wherewith I make strong the spirit within each one of you.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.227">Therefore a man must now turn his face straight forward, and perish</p>
	<p id="IL.17.228">or survive. This is the sweet invitation of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.229">That man of you who drags Patroklos, dead as he is, back</p>
	<p id="IL.17.230">among Trojans, breakers of horses, and Aias gives way before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.231">I will give him half the spoils for his portion, and keep half</p>
	<p id="IL.17.232">for myself, and his glory shall be as great as mine is.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.233">So he spoke, and they lifted their spears and went straight for the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.234">who felt their weight, and inside each man the spirit was hopeful</p>
	<p id="IL.17.235">to get the body away from Telamonian Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.236">Fools! Since over the dead man he tore the life out of many.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.237">Then Aias himself spoke to Menelaos of the great war cry:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.238">'Illustrious Menelaos, dear friend, I no longer have hope</p>
	<p id="IL.17.239">that even you and I can win back out of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.240">My fear is not so much for the dead body of Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.241">who presently must glut the dogs and the birds of Troy, so much</p>
	<p id="IL.17.242">as I fear for my own head, my life, and what may befall it,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.243">and for yours, since this cloud of war is darkened on all things,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.244">this Hektor, while for you and me sheer death is emerging.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.245">Come then, call the great men of the Danaans, if one might hear you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.246">He spoke, and Menelaos of the great war cry obeyed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.247">He lifted his voice and called in a piercing cry to the Danaans:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.248">'Friends, o leaders and men of counsel among the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.249">you that beside Agamemnon and Menelaos, the two sons</p>
	<p id="IL.17.250">of Atreus, drink the community's wine and give, each man, his orders</p>
	<p id="IL.17.251">to the people; and from Zeus the respect and honour attend you.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.252">It is hard for me to discriminate among you each man</p>
	<p id="IL.17.253">who is a leader, so big is the bitter fight that has blazed up.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.254">Then let a man come of his own accord, think it shameful</p>
	<p id="IL.17.255">that Patroklos be given to the dogs of Troy to delight them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.256">He spoke, and swift Aias son of Oïleus was sharp to hear him</p>
	<p id="IL.17.257">and was first to come running along the battle, and join him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.258">and after him Idomeneus, and Idomeneus' companion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.259">Meriones, a match for the murderous lord of battles.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.260">But what man could tell forth from his heart the names of the others,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.261">all who after these waked the war strength of the Achaians?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.262">The Trojans came down on them in a pack, and Hektor led them.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.263">As when at the outpouring place of a rain-glutted river</p>
	<p id="IL.17.264">the huge surf of the sea roars against the current, out-jutting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.265">beaches thunder aloud to the backwash of the salt water,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.266">with such a bellow the Trojans came on, but now the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.17.267">stood fast about the son of Menoitios, in a single courage</p>
	<p id="IL.17.268">and fenced beneath their bronze-armoured shields, while the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.269">drifted across the glitter of their helmets a deepening</p>
	<p id="IL.17.270">mist; since before this time he had not hated Menoitios'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.271">son, while he lived yet and was Achilleus' companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.272">and loathed now that he should become the spoil of the hated</p>
	<p id="IL.17.273">Trojans' dogs, and stirred his companions on to defend him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.274">First the Trojans shouldered back the glancing-eyed Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.275">who abandoned the body and ran for terror, nor did the high-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.17.276">Trojans take any with their spears, for all of their striving,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.277">but dragged at the dead man, only the Achaians were not long destined</p>
	<p id="IL.17.278">to fail him, since they were pulled around in sudden speed</p>
	<p id="IL.17.279">by Aias, who for his beauty and the work of his hands surpassed</p>
	<p id="IL.17.280">all other Danaans, after the blameless son of Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.281">He steered through the front fighters in pride of strength like a savage</p>
	<p id="IL.17.282">wild boar, who among the mountains easily scatters</p>
	<p id="IL.17.283">the dogs and strong young men when he turns at bay in the valley.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.284">So now the son of haughty Telamon, glorious Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.285">turned to charge and easily scatter the Trojan battalions,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.286">who had taken their stand bestriding Patroklos, in high hope</p>
	<p id="IL.17.287">of dragging him off to their own city, and so winning honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.288">Indeed, Hippothoös, glorious son of Pelasgian Lethos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.289">was trying to drag him by the foot through the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.17.290">by fastening the sling of his shield round the ankle tendons</p>
	<p id="IL.17.291">for the favour of Hektor and the Trojans, but the sudden evil</p>
	<p id="IL.17.292">came to him, and none for all their desire could defend him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.293">The son of Telamon, sweeping in through the mass of the fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.294">struck him at close quarters through the brazen cheeks of his helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.17.295">and the helm crested with horse-hair was riven about the spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.17.296">to the impact of the huge spear and the weight of the hand behind it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.297">and the brain ran from the wound along the spear by the eye-hole,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.298">bleeding. There his strength was washed away, and from his hands</p>
	<p id="IL.17.299">he let fall to the ground the foot of great-hearted Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.300">to lie there, and himself collapsed prone over the dead man</p>
	<p id="IL.17.301">far away from generous Larisa, and he could not</p>
	<p id="IL.17.302">render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.303">beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.304">Again Hektor threw at Aias with the shining javelin,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.305">but Aias with his eyes straight on him avoided the bronze spear</p>
	<p id="IL.17.306">by a little, and Hektor struck Schedios, the son of high-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.17.307">Iphitos and far the best of the Phokians, one who lived</p>
	<p id="IL.17.308">in his home in famous Panopeus and was lord over many people.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.309">He struck him fair beneath the collar-bone, and the pointed</p>
	<p id="IL.17.310">bronze head tore clean through and came out by the base of the shoulder.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.311">He fell, thunderously, and his armour clattered upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.312">But Aias in turn cut at Phorkys, the wise son of Phainops,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.313">in the middle of the belly as he stood over fallen Hippothoös,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.314">and broke the hollow of the corselet, so that the entrails spurted</p>
	<p id="IL.17.315">from the bronze, and he went down clawing the dust in his fingers.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.316">The champions of Troy gave back then, and glorious Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.317">and the Argives gave a great cry and dragged back the bodies</p>
	<p id="IL.17.318">of Hippothoös and Phorkys, and eased the armour from their shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.319">Then, once more, might the Trojans have climbed back into Ilion's</p>
	<p id="IL.17.320">wall, subdued by terror before the warlike Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.321">and the Argives, even beyond Zeus' destiny, might have won glory</p>
	<p id="IL.17.322">by their own force and strength, had not Apollo in person</p>
	<p id="IL.17.323">stirred on Aineias; he had assumed the form of the herald</p>
	<p id="IL.17.324">Periphas, Epytos' son, growing old in his herald's office</p>
	<p id="IL.17.325">by Aineias' aged father, and a man whose thoughts were of kindness.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.326">In the likeness of this man Zeus' son Apollo spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.327">'Aineias, how could you be the men to defend sheer Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.328">even against a god's will, as I have seen other men do it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.329">in the confidence of their own force and strength, their own manhood</p>
	<p id="IL.17.330">and their own numbers, though they had too few people for it?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.331">But now Zeus wishes the victory far rather for our side</p>
	<p id="IL.17.332">than the Danaans', only yourselves keep blenching and will not fight them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.333">So he spoke, but Aineias knew far-striking Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.17.334">as he looked him straight in the face, and called in a great voice to Hektor:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.335">'Hektor, and you other lords of the Trojans and their companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.336">here is a shameful thing! We are climbing back into Ilion's</p>
	<p id="IL.17.337">wall, subdued by terror before the warlike Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.338">Yet see, some one of the gods is standing beside me, and tells me</p>
	<p id="IL.17.339">that Zeus the supreme counsellor lends his weight to our fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.340">Therefore we must go straight for the Danaans, so that they may not</p>
	<p id="IL.17.341">carry thus easily back to their ships the fallen Patroklos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.342">He spoke, and with a long leap stood far before the front fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.343">and the Trojans turned and held their ground against the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.344">And now Aineias killed Leiokritos, with a spear-thrust,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.345">the son of Arisbas and noble companion of Lykomedes;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.346">but as he fell the warrior Lykomedes pitied him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.347">and stood close in, and made a cast with the shining javelin</p>
	<p id="IL.17.348">and struck Apisaon, son of Hippasos, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.349">in the liver under the midriff, and the strength of his knees was broken.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.350">He was one who had come from Paionia of the rich soil</p>
	<p id="IL.17.351">and was best of her men in fighting next to Asteropaios.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.352">As this man fell, warlike Asteropaios pitied him</p>
	<p id="IL.17.353">and he in turn drove forward eager to fight with the Danaans,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.354">but was not able to do it, for they, standing about Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.355">fenced him behind their shields on all sides, and held their spears out-thrust.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.356">For Aias ranged their whole extent with his numerous orders,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.357">and would not let any man give back from the body, nor let one</p>
	<p id="IL.17.358">go out and fight by himself far in front of the other Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.359">but made them stand hard and fast about him and fight at close quarters.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.360">Such were the orders of gigantic Aias. The ground ran</p>
	<p id="IL.17.361">with red blood, the dead men dropped one after another</p>
	<p id="IL.17.362">from the ranks alike of Trojans and their mighty companions</p>
	<p id="IL.17.363">and Danaans also, since these fought not without bloodletting,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.364">but far fewer of them went down, since they ever remembered</p>
	<p id="IL.17.365">always to stand massed and beat sudden death from each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.366">So they fought on in the likeness of fire, nor would you have thought</p>
	<p id="IL.17.367">the sun was still secure in his place in the sky, nor the moon, since</p>
	<p id="IL.17.368">the mist was closed over all that part of the fight where the bravest</p>
	<p id="IL.17.369">stood about Patroklos, the fallen son of Menoitios.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.370">Now elsewhere the rest of the Trojans and strong-greaved Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.17.371">fought naturally in the bright air, with the sun's sharp glitter</p>
	<p id="IL.17.372">everywhere about them, no cloud was showing anywhere</p>
	<p id="IL.17.373">on earth nor on the mountains. They fought their battle by intervals</p>
	<p id="IL.17.374">standing each well off at a distance, avoiding the painful</p>
	<p id="IL.17.375">shots from the other side; but they in the middle were suffering</p>
	<p id="IL.17.376">distress in the mist and the fighting, with the cruel bronze wearing them.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.377">These men were the bravest, but there were two men of glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.378">Thrasymedes and Antilochos, who had not yet heard</p>
	<p id="IL.17.379">how Patroklos the blameless had been killed, but still thought</p>
	<p id="IL.17.380">he was alive and fighting in the first shock with the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.381">But these two, watching against death or flight in their company,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.382">fought their separate battle, since such was their order from Nestor</p>
	<p id="IL.17.383">as he was urging them forth from the black ships into the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.384">So for these daylong the hard bitterness of the wearing</p>
	<p id="IL.17.385">battle rose. With the ever-relentless sweat and the weariness</p>
	<p id="IL.17.386">knees, legs, and feet that supported from underneath each fighter,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.387">their hands and eyes also were running wet as they fought on</p>
	<p id="IL.17.388">over the brave henchman of swift-footed Aiakides.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.389">As when a man gives the hide of a great ox, a bullock,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.390">drenched first deep in fat, to all his people to stretch out;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.391">the people take it from him and stand in a circle about it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.392">and pull, and presently the moisture goes and the fat sinks</p>
	<p id="IL.17.393">in, with so many pulling, and the bull's hide is stretched out level;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.394">so the men of both sides in a cramped space tugged at the body</p>
	<p id="IL.17.395">in both directions; and the hearts of the Trojans were hopeful</p>
	<p id="IL.17.396">to drag him away to Ilion, those of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.17.397">to get him back to the hollow ships. And about him a savage</p>
	<p id="IL.17.398">struggle arose. Not Ares who rallies men, not Athene,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.399">watching this fight could have scorned it, not even in some strong anger,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.400">such was the wicked work of battle for men and for horses</p>
	<p id="IL.17.401">Zeus strained tight above Patroklos that day. But the brilliant</p>
	<p id="IL.17.402">Achilleus did not yet know at all that Patroklos had fallen.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.403">Since now the men were fighting far away from the fast ships</p>
	<p id="IL.17.404">under the Trojan wall, and Achilleus had no expectation</p>
	<p id="IL.17.405">that Patroklos was dead, but thought he was alive and close under</p>
	<p id="IL.17.406">the gates, and would come back. He had not thought that Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.407">would storm the city without himself, nor with himself either;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.408">for often he had word from his mother, not known to mortals;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.409">she was ever telling him what was the will of great Zeus; but this time</p>
	<p id="IL.17.410">his mother did not tell Achilleus of all the evil</p>
	<p id="IL.17.411">that had been done, nor how his dearest companion had perished.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.412">So they about the body gripping their headed spears kept</p>
	<p id="IL.17.413">inexorably close together, and slaughtered on both sides.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.414">And such would be the saying of some bronze-armoured Achaian:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.415">'Friends, there is no glory for us if we go back again</p>
	<p id="IL.17.416">to our hollow ships, but here and now let the black earth open</p>
	<p id="IL.17.417">gaping for all; this would soon be far better for us</p>
	<p id="IL.17.418">if we give up this man to the Trojans, breakers of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.419">to take away to their own city and win glory from him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.420">And such in turn would be the cry of some high-hearted Trojan:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.421">'O friends, though it be destined for all of us to be killed here</p>
	<p id="IL.17.422">over this man, still none of us must give ground from the fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.423">Thus a man would speak, and stir the spirit in each one</p>
	<p id="IL.17.424">of his fellowship. So they fought on, and the iron tumult</p>
	<p id="IL.17.425">went up into the brazen sky through the barren bright air.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.426">But the horses of Aiakides standing apart from the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.427">wept, as they had done since they heard how their charioteer</p>
	<p id="IL.17.428">had fallen in the dust at the hands of murderous Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.429">In truth Automedon, the powerful son of Diores,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.430">hit them over and over again with the stroke of the flying</p>
	<p id="IL.17.431">lash, or talked to them, sometimes entreating them, sometimes threatening.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.432">They were unwilling to go back to the wide passage of Helle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.433">and the ships, or back into the fighting after the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.434">but still as stands a grave monument which is set over</p>
	<p id="IL.17.435">the mounded tomb of a dead man or lady, they stood there</p>
	<p id="IL.17.436">holding motionless in its place the fair-wrought chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.437">leaning their heads along the ground, and warm tears were running</p>
	<p id="IL.17.438">earthward from underneath the lids of the mourning horses</p>
	<p id="IL.17.439">who longed for their charioteer, while their bright manes were made dirty</p>
	<p id="IL.17.440">as they streamed down either side of the yoke from under the yoke pad.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.441">As he watched the mourning horses the son of Kronos pitied them,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.442">and stirred his head and spoke to his own spirit: 'Poor wretches,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.443">why then did we ever give you to the lord Peleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.444">a mortal man, and you yourselves are immortal and ageless?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.445">Only so that among unhappy men you also might be grieved?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.446">Since among all creatures that breathe on earth and crawl on it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.447">there is not anywhere a thing more dismal than man is.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.448">At least the son of Priam, Hektor, shall not mount behind you</p>
	<p id="IL.17.449">in the carefully wrought chariot. I will not let him. Is it not</p>
	<p id="IL.17.450">enough for him that he has the armour and glories in wearing it?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.451">But now I will put vigour into your knees and your spirits</p>
	<p id="IL.17.452">so that you bring back Automedon out of the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.453">safe to the hollow ships; since I shall still give the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.454">the glory of killing, until they win to the strong-benched vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.455">until the sun goes down and the blessed darkness comes over.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.456">So spoke Zeus, and breathed great vigour into the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.457">and they shaking the dust from their manes to the ground lightly</p>
	<p id="IL.17.458">carried the running chariot among the Achaians and Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.459">Automedon fought from them, though grieving for his companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.460">He would dash in, like a vulture among geese, with his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.461">and lightly get away out of the Trojans' confusion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.462">and lightly charge in again in pursuit of a great multitude,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.463">and yet could kill no men when he swept in in chase of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.464">He had no way while he was alone in a separate chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.17.465">to lunge with the spear and still keep in hand his fast-running horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.466">But at last there was one of his companions who laid eyes upon him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.467">Alkimedon, the son of Laerkes, descended from Haimon.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.468">He stood behind the chariot and called to Automedon:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.469">'Automedon, what god put this unprofitable purpose</p>
	<p id="IL.17.470">into your heart, and has taken away the better wits, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.17.471">you are trying to fight the Trojans in the first shock of encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.17.472">by yourself, since your companion has been killed, and Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.17.473">glories in wearing Aiakides' armour on his own shoulders?'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.474">In turn Automedon answered him, the son of Diores:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.475">'Alkimedon, which other of the Achaians could handle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.476">the management and the strength of immortal horses as you can,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.477">were it not Patroklos, the equal of the immortals in counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.478">while he lived? Now death and fate have closed in upon him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.479">Therefore take over from me the whip and the glittering guide reins</p>
	<p id="IL.17.480">while I dismount from behind the horses, so I may do battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.481">He spoke, and Alkimedon vaulted up to the charging chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.17.482">and quickly gathered up the reins and the lash in his hands, while</p>
	<p id="IL.17.483">Automedon sprang down. But glorious Hektor saw them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.484">and immediately spoke to Aineias, who stood close beside him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.485">'Aineias, lord of the counsels of the bronze-armoured Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.486">I see before us the horses of swift-footed Aiakides</p>
	<p id="IL.17.487">who appear now in the fighting with weak charioteers. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.17.488">I could be hopeful of their capture, if you were willing</p>
	<p id="IL.17.489">in heart to go with me. If we two went forth against them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.490">they would not dare to stand their ground and do battle against us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.491">He spoke, and the strong son of Anchises did not disobey him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.492">The two went strongly forward, hooding their shoulders in well-tanned</p>
	<p id="IL.17.493">and stubborn hides of oxen with deep bronze beaten upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.494">Along with these went Chromios and godlike Aretos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.495">both together, and the spirit within each had high hopes</p>
	<p id="IL.17.496">of killing the men and driving away the strong-necked horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.497">poor fools, who were not going to come back from Automedon</p>
	<p id="IL.17.498">without the shedding of blood; and he with a prayer to Zeus father</p>
	<p id="IL.17.499">was filled about the darkening heart with war-strength and courage,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.500">and spoke now to Alkimedon his trusted companion:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.501">'Alkimedon, no longer check the horses back from me</p>
	<p id="IL.17.502">but keep them breathing right against my back. I have no thought</p>
	<p id="IL.17.503">that I can stand up to the strength of Hektor the son of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.504">Sooner, I think, he will kill us and mount behind the mane-floating</p>
	<p id="IL.17.505">horses of Achilleus, and scatter the ranks of the Argive</p>
	<p id="IL.17.506">fighting men; or else himself go down in the first rush.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.507">He spoke, and called to the two Aiantes and Menelaos:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.508">'Aiantes, lords of the Argives, and Menelaos, we call you</p>
	<p id="IL.17.509">to leave the dead man in the care of those who are fittest</p>
	<p id="IL.17.510">to stand bestriding him and fend off the ranks of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.511">while you beat back the day without pity from us who are living.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.512">For Hektor and Aineias, the greatest men of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.513">are leaning the weight of their charge this way through the sorrowful battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.514">Yet all these are things that are lying upon the gods' knees.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.515">I myself will cast; and Zeus will look after the issue.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.516">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far-shadowed, and threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.517">and struck the shield of Aretos on its perfect circle,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.518">nor could the shield hold off the spear, but the bronze smashed clean through</p>
	<p id="IL.17.519">and was driven on through the belt to the deep of the belly.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.520">As when a strong-grown man with sharp axe in his hands chops</p>
	<p id="IL.17.521">at an ox, ranger of the fields, behind the horns, cutting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.522">all the way through the sinew, and the ox springing forward topples,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.523">so Aretos sprang forward, then toppled back, and sharp-driven</p>
	<p id="IL.17.524">into the depth of his belly the quivering spear unstrung him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.525">Then Hektor made a cast with the shining spear at Automedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.526">but he, keeping his eyes straight on him, avoided the bronze spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.527">For he bent forward, and behind his back the long spearshaft</p>
	<p id="IL.17.528">was driven into the ground so that the butt end was shaken</p>
	<p id="IL.17.529">on the spear. Then and there Ares the huge took the force from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.530">And now they would have gone for each other with swords at close quarters,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.531">had not the two Aiantes driven strongly between them,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.532">who came on through the battle at the call of their companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.533">and in fear before them Hektor and Aineias and godlike</p>
	<p id="IL.17.534">Chromios gave ground back and away once more, leaving</p>
	<p id="IL.17.535">Aretos lying there where he was with a wound in his vitals.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.536">Then Automedon, a match for the running god of battles,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.537">stripped the armour, and spoke a word of boasting above him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.538">'Now I have put a little sorrow from my heart for Patroklos'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.539">death, although the man I killed was not great as he was.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.540">So he spoke, and took up the bloody war spoils and laid them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.541">inside the chariot, and himself mounted it, the blood running</p>
	<p id="IL.17.542">from hands and feet, as on some lion who has eaten a bullock.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.543">Once again over Patroklos was close drawn a strong battle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.544">weary and sorrowful, and Athene from the sky descending</p>
	<p id="IL.17.545">waked the bitter fighting, since Zeus of the wide brows sent her</p>
	<p id="IL.17.546">down to stir the Danaans, for now his purpose had shifted.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.547">As when in the sky Zeus strings for mortals the shimmering</p>
	<p id="IL.17.548">rainbow, to be a portent and sign of war, or of wintry</p>
	<p id="IL.17.549">storm, when heat perishes, such storm as stops mortals'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.550">work upon the face of the earth, and afflicts their cattle,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.551">so Athene shrouded in the shimmering cloud about her</p>
	<p id="IL.17.552">merged among the swarming Achaians, and wakened each man.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.553">And first she spoke, stirring him on, to the son of Atreus,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.554">strong Menelaos, since he was the one who was standing close to her.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.555">She likened hereself in form and weariless voice to Phoinix:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.556">'Menelaos, this will be a thing of shame, a reproach said</p>
	<p id="IL.17.557">of you, if under the wall of the Trojans the dogs in their fury</p>
	<p id="IL.17.558">can mutilate the staunch companion of haughty Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.559">But hold strongly on, and stir up all the rest of your people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.560">Then in turn Menelaos of the great war cry answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.561">'Phoinix, my father, aged and honoured, if only Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.17.562">would give me such strength, and hold the volleying missiles off from me!</p>
	<p id="IL.17.563">So for my part I would be willing to stand by Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.564">and defend him, since in his death he hurt my heart greatly.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.565">Yet Hektor holds still the awful strength of a fire, nor falters</p>
	<p id="IL.17.566">in raging with the bronze spear, since Zeus is giving him glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.567">So he spoke, and the goddess grey-eyed Athene was happy</p>
	<p id="IL.17.568">that first among all the divinities his prayer had bespoken her.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.569">She put strength into the man's shoulders and knees, inspiring</p>
	<p id="IL.17.570">in his breast the persistent daring of that mosquito</p>
	<p id="IL.17.571">who though it is driven hard away from a man's skin, even</p>
	<p id="IL.17.572">so, for the taste of human blood, persists in biting him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.573">With such daring she darkened to fullness the heart inside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.574">He stood over Patroklos, and made a cast with the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.17.575">spear. There was one among the Trojans, Podes, Eëtion's</p>
	<p id="IL.17.576">son, a rich man and good, whom Hektor prized above others</p>
	<p id="IL.17.577">in the countryside, since he was his friend and ate at his table.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.578">Now fair-haired Menelaos struck this man, at the war belt</p>
	<p id="IL.17.579">as he swept away in flight, and drove the bronze spear clean through it.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.580">He fell, thunderously, and Atreus' son Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.581">dragged the body away from the Trojans among his companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.582">But now Apollo came and stood beside Hektor, and stirred him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.583">assuming the shape of Phainops, Asios' son, who among all</p>
	<p id="IL.17.584">guest friends was dearest to Hektor, and lived at home in Abydos.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.585">In the likeness of this man far-striking Apollo spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.586">'Hektor, what other Achaian now shall be frightened before you?</p>
	<p id="IL.17.587">See, you have shrunk before Menelaos, who in times before this</p>
	<p id="IL.17.588">was a soft spearfighter; and now he has gone taking off single-handed</p>
	<p id="IL.17.589">a body from among the Trojans. He has killed your trusted companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.590">valiant among the champions, Podes, the son of Eëtion.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.591">He spoke, and the dark cloud of sorrow closed over Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.592">He took his way among the champions helmed in the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.17.593">bronze. And now the son of Kronos caught up the betasselled</p>
	<p id="IL.17.594">glaring aegis, and shrouded Ida in mists. He let go</p>
	<p id="IL.17.595">a lightning flash and a loud thunderstroke, shaking the mountain,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.596">gave victory to the Trojans, and terrified the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.597">First to begin the flight was Peneleos the Boiotian.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.598">For he, turning always toward the attack, was hit in the shoulder's</p>
	<p id="IL.17.599">end, a slight wound, but the spear of Poulydamas, who had thrown it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.600">from a stance very close to him, had grated the bone's edge.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.601">Then Hektor wounded in the hand by the wrist Leïtos,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.602">the son of great-hearted Alektryon, and halted his warcraft,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.603">and he drew back staring about him since his spirit had hope no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.17.604">of holding a spear steady in his hand to fight with the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.605">Now as Hektor made a rush for Leïtos, Idomeneus</p>
	<p id="IL.17.606">struck him on the corselet over the chest by the nipple,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.607">but the long shaft was broken behind the head, and the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.608">shouted. Now Hektor made a cast at Deukalian Idomeneus</p>
	<p id="IL.17.609">as he stood in his chariot, and missed him by only a little,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.610">but struck the follower and charioteer of Meriones,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.611">Koiranos, who had come with him from strong-founded Lyktos.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.612">Now Idomeneus at the first had come on foot, leaving the oarswept</p>
	<p id="IL.17.613">ships, and now would have given the Trojans a mighty triumph,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.614">had not Koiranos swiftly come up with the fast-running horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.615">came as light to the other and beat from him the day without pity,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.616">but himself lost his life at the hands of manslaughtering Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.617">who hit him under the jaw by the ear, and the spearshaft pushed out</p>
	<p id="IL.17.618">his teeth by the roots from the base, and split the tongue through the middle.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.619">He toppled from the chariot, with the reins on the ground scattered,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.620">but Meriones leaning down caught these up in his own hands</p>
	<p id="IL.17.621">from the surface of the plain, and called aloud to Idomeneus:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.622">'Lash them now, until you can get back to our fast ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.623">You see yourself there is no more strength left in the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.624">So he spoke, and Idomeneus whipped the mane-floating horses</p>
	<p id="IL.17.625">back to the hollow ships, with fear fallen upon his spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.626">Nor was it unseen by great-hearted Aias how Zeus shifted</p>
	<p id="IL.17.627">the strength of the fighting toward the Trojans, nor by Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.628">First of the two to speak was huge Telamonian Aias:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.629">'Shame on it! By now even one with a child's innocence</p>
	<p id="IL.17.630">could see how father Zeus himself is helping the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.631">The weapons of each of these take hold, no matter who throws them,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.632">good fighter or bad, since Zeus is straightening all of them equally,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.633">while ours fall to the ground and are utterly useless. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.17.634">let us deliberate with ourselves upon the best counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.635">how at the same time to rescue the dead body, and also</p>
	<p id="IL.17.636">win back ourselves, and bring joy to our beloved companions</p>
	<p id="IL.17.637">who look our way and sorrow for us, and believe no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.17.638">that the fury of manslaughtering Hektor, his hands irresistible,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.639">can be held, but must be driven on to the black ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.640">But there should be some companion who could carry the message</p>
	<p id="IL.17.641">quickly to Peleus' son, since I think he has not yet heard</p>
	<p id="IL.17.642">the ghastly news, how his beloved companion has fallen.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.643">Yet I cannot make out such a man among the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.644">since they are held in the mist alike, the men and their horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.645">Father Zeus, draw free from the mist the sons of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.646">make bright the air, and give sight back to our eyes; in shining</p>
	<p id="IL.17.647">daylight destroy us, if to destroy us be now your pleasure.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.648">He spoke thus, and as he wept the father took pity upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.649">and forthwith scattered the mist and pushed the darkness back from them,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.650">and the sun blazed out, and all the battle was plain before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.651">Now Aias spoke to him of the great war cry, Menelaos:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.652">'Look hard, illustrious Menelaos, if you can discover</p>
	<p id="IL.17.653">Antilochos still living, the son of great-hearted Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.654">and send him out to run with a message to wise Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.17.655">how one who was far the dearest of his companions has fallen.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.656">He spoke, and Menelaos of the great war cry obeyed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.657">and went on his way, as from a mid-fenced ground some lion</p>
	<p id="IL.17.658">who has been harrying dogs and men, but his strength is worn out;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.659">they will not let him tear out the fat of the oxen, watching</p>
	<p id="IL.17.660">nightlong against him, and he in his hunger for meat closes in</p>
	<p id="IL.17.661">but can get nothing of what he wants, for the raining javelins</p>
	<p id="IL.17.662">thrown from the daring hands of the men beat ever against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.663">and the flaming torches, and these he balks at for all of his fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.664">and with the daylight goes away, disappointed of desire;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.665">so Menelaos of the great war cry went from Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.666">much unwilling, and was afraid for him, lest the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.17.667">under pressure of fear might leave him as spoil for the enemy,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.668">and had much to urge on Meriones and the Aiantes:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.669">'Aiantes, o lords of the Argives, and you, Meriones,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.670">now let each one of you remember unhappy Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.671">who was gentle, and understood how to be kindly toward all men</p>
	<p id="IL.17.672">while he lived. Now death and fate have closed in upon him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.673">So spoke fair-haired Menelaos, and went away from them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.674">peering about on all sides, like an eagle, who, as men say,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.675">sees most sharply of all winged creatures under the heaven,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.676">and lofty though he hover the cowering hare, the swift-footed,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.677">escapes not his sight as he crouches in the shaggy bush, but the eagle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.678">plunges suddenly to grab him and tear the life from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.679">So now in you, Menelaos, illustrious, the eyes shining</p>
	<p id="IL.17.680">circled everywhere your swarming hordes of companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.681">if the man might see anywhere Nestor's son, still living,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.682">and saw soon where he was, at the left of the entire battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.683">encouraging his companions and urging them into the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.684">Menelaos the fair-haired stood beside him and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.685">'Antilochos, turn this way, illustrious, and hear from me</p>
	<p id="IL.17.686">the ghastly message of a thing I wish never had happened.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.687">You can see for yourself, I think, already, from watching,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.688">how the god is wheeling disaster against the Danaans</p>
	<p id="IL.17.689">and how the Trojans are winning. The best of the Achaians has fallen,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.690">Patroklos, and a huge loss is inflicted upon the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.691">Run then quickly to Achilleus, by the ships of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.692">and tell him. He might in speed win back to his ship the dead body</p>
	<p id="IL.17.693">which is naked. Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.694">So he spoke, and Antilochos hated his word as he listened.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.695">He stayed for a long time without a word, speechless, and his eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.17.696">filled with tears, the springing voice was held still within him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.697">yet even so he neglected not Menelaos' order</p>
	<p id="IL.17.698">but went on the run, handing his war gear to a blameless companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.699">Laodokos, who had turned nearby his single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.700">Now as his feet carried him, weeping, out of the battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.701">with his message of evil for the son of Peleus, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.702">so now, Menelaos, the spirit in you, illustrious,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.703">wished not to defend his stricken companions, after Antilochos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.704">was gone from them, and his loss wrought greatly upon the Pylians;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.705">rather he sent Thrasymedes the brilliant over to help them,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.706">while he himself went back again to the hero Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.17.707">running, and took his place beside the Aiantes, and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.708">'Now I have sent the man you spoke of back to the fast ships</p>
	<p id="IL.17.709">on his way to swift-footed Achilleus, yet think not even</p>
	<p id="IL.17.710">he can come now, for all his great anger with Hektor the brilliant.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.711">There is no way he could fight bare of armour against the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.712">We by ourselves must deliberate upon the best counsel</p>
	<p id="IL.17.713">how at the same time to rescue the dead body, and also</p>
	<p id="IL.17.714">ourselves escape death and destiny from the clamouring Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.715">Then in turn huge Telamonian Aias answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.17.716">'All you have said, renowned Menelaos, is fair and orderly.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.717">But come: you and Meriones stoop and shoulder the body</p>
	<p id="IL.17.718">at once, and carry it out of the hard fighting. Behind you</p>
	<p id="IL.17.719">we two shall fight off the Trojans and glorious Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.720">we, who have the same name, the same spirit, and who in times past</p>
	<p id="IL.17.721">have stood fast beside each other in the face of the bitter war god.'</p>
	<p id="IL.17.722">He spoke, and they caught the body from the ground in their arms, lifting</p>
	<p id="IL.17.723">him high with a great heave, and the Trojan people behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.724">shouted aloud as they saw the Achaians lifting the dead man,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.725">and made a rush against them like dogs, who sweep in rapidly</p>
	<p id="IL.17.726">on a wounded wild boar, ahead of the young men who hunt him,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.727">and for the moment race in raging to tear him to pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.17.728">until in the confidence of his strength he turns on them, at bay,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.729">and they give ground and scatter for fear one way and another;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.730">so the Trojans until that time kept always in close chase</p>
	<p id="IL.17.731">assembled, stabbing at them with swords and leaf-headed spears,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.732">but every time the two Aiantes would swing round to face them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.733">and stand fast, the colour of their skin changed, and no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.17.734">could any endure to sweep in further and fight for the body.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.735">So these, straining, carried the dead man out of the battle</p>
	<p id="IL.17.736">and back to the hollow ships, and the fight that was drawn fast between them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.737">was wild as fire which, risen suddenly, storming a city</p>
	<p id="IL.17.738">of men sets it ablaze, and houses diminish before it</p>
	<p id="IL.17.739">in the high glare, and the force of the wind on it roars it to thunder;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.740">so, as the Danaans made their way back, the weariless roaring</p>
	<p id="IL.17.741">of horses, chariots, and spearmen was ever upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.742">But they, as mules who have put the on-drive of strength upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.743">drag down from the high ground along a steep stony trail either</p>
	<p id="IL.17.744">a beam or some big timber for a ship, and the heart in them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.745">wearies under the hard work and sweat of their urgent endeavour;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.746">so these, straining, carried the dead man away, and behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.747">the two Aiantes held them off, as a timbered rock ridge</p>
	<p id="IL.17.748">holds off water, one that is placed to divide an entire plain,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.749">which, though flood-currents of strong rivers drive sorely against it,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.750">holds them off and beats back the waters of them all to be scattered</p>
	<p id="IL.17.751">over the plain, and all the strength of their streams cannot break it;</p>
	<p id="IL.17.752">so behind the Achaians the Aiantes held off forever</p>
	<p id="IL.17.753">the Trojan attack. But these stayed close, and two beyond others,</p>
	<p id="IL.17.754">Aineias, who was son of Anchises, and glorious Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.755">But before these, as goes a cloud of daws or of starlings</p>
	<p id="IL.17.756">screaming terror when they have seen coming forth against them</p>
	<p id="IL.17.757">the hawk, whose coming is murder for the little birds, so now</p>
	<p id="IL.17.758">before Aineias and Hektor the young Achaian warriors</p>
	<p id="IL.17.759">went, screaming terror, all the delight of battle forgotten.</p>
	<p id="IL.17.760">Many fine pieces of armour littered the ground on both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.17.761">of the ditch, as the Danaans fled. There was no check in the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.1">So these fought on in the likeness of blazing fire. Meanwhile,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.2">Antilochos came, a swift-footed messenger, to Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.3">and found him sitting in front of the steep-horned ships, thinking</p>
	<p id="IL.18.4">over in his heart of things which had now been accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.5">Disturbed, Achilleus spoke to the spirit in his own great heart:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.6">'Ah me, how is it that once again the flowing-haired Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.18.7">are driven out of the plain on their ships in fear and confusion?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.8">May the gods not accomplish vile sorrows upon the heart in me</p>
	<p id="IL.18.9">in the way my mother once made it clear to me, when she told me</p>
	<p id="IL.18.10">how while I yet lived the bravest of all the Myrmidons</p>
	<p id="IL.18.11">must leave the light of the sun beneath the hands of the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.12">Surely, then, the strong son of Menoitios has perished.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.13">Unhappy! and yet I told him, once he had beaten the fierce fire</p>
	<p id="IL.18.14">off, to come back to the ships, not fight in strength against Hektor.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.15">Now as he was pondering this in his heart and his spirit,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.16">meanwhile the son of stately Nestor was drawing near him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.17">and wept warm tears, and gave Achilleus his sorrowful message:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.18">'Ah me, son of valiant Peleus; you must hear from me</p>
	<p id="IL.18.19">the ghastly message of a thing I wish never had happened.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.20">Patroklos has fallen, and now they are fighting over his body</p>
	<p id="IL.18.21">which is naked. Hektor of the shining helm has taken his armour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.22">He spoke, and the black cloud of sorrow closed on Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.23">In both hands he caught up the grimy dust, and poured it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.24">over his head and face, and fouled his handsome countenance,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.25">and the black ashes were scattered over his immortal tunic.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.26">And he himself, mightily in his might, in the dust lay</p>
	<p id="IL.18.27">at length, and took and tore at his hair with his hands, and defiled it.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.28">And the handmaidens Achilleus and Patroklos had taken</p>
	<p id="IL.18.29">captive, stricken at heart cried out aloud, and came running</p>
	<p id="IL.18.30">out of doors about valiant Achilleus, and all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.31">beat their breasts with their hands, and the limbs went slack in each of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.32">On the other side Antilochos mourned with him, letting the tears fall,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.33">and held the hands of Achilleus as he grieved in his proud heart,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.34">fearing Achilleus might cut his throat with the iron. He cried out</p>
	<p id="IL.18.35">terribly, aloud, and the lady his mother heard him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.36">as she sat in the depths of the sea at the side of her aged father,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.37">and she cried shrill in turn, and the goddesses gathered about her,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.38">all who along the depth of the sea were daughters of Nereus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.39">For Glauke was there, Kymodoke and Thaleia,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.40">Nesaie and Speio and Thoë, and ox-eyed Halia;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.41">Kymothoëwas there, Aktaia and Limnoreia,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.42">Melite and Iaira, Amphithoëand Agauë,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.43">Doto and Proto, Dynamene and Pherousa,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.44">Dexamene and Amphinome and Kallianeira;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.45">Doris and Panope and glorious Galateia,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.46">Nemertes and Apseudes and Kallianassa;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.47">Klymene was there, Ianeira and Ianassa,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.48">Maira and Oreithyia and lovely-haired Amatheia,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.49">and the rest who along the depth of the sea were daughters of Nereus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.50">The silvery cave was filled with these, and together all of them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.51">beat their breasts, and among them Thetis led out the threnody:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.52">'Hear me, Nereids, my sisters; so you may all know</p>
	<p id="IL.18.53">well all the sorrows that are in my heart, when you hear of them from me.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.54">Ah me, my sorrow, the bitterness in this best of child-bearing,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.55">since I gave birth to a son who was without fault and powerful,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.56">conspicuous among heroes; and he shot up like a young tree,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.57">and I nurtured him, like a tree grown in the pride of the orchard.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.58">I sent him away with the curved ships into the land of Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.59">to fight with the Trojans; but I shall never again receive him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.60">won home again to his country and into the house of Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.61">Yet while I see him live and he looks on the sunlight, he has</p>
	<p id="IL.18.62">sorrows, and though I go to him I can do nothing to help him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.63">Yet I shall go, to look on my dear son, and to listen</p>
	<p id="IL.18.64">to the sorrow that has come to him as he stays back from the fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.65">So she spoke, and left the cave, and the others together</p>
	<p id="IL.18.66">went with her in tears, and about them the wave of the water</p>
	<p id="IL.18.67">was broken. Now these, when they came to the generous Troad,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.68">followed each other out on the sea-shore, where close together</p>
	<p id="IL.18.69">the ships of the Myrmidons were hauled up about swift Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.70">There as he sighed heavily the lady his mother stood by him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.71">and cried out shrill and aloud, and took her son's head in her arms, then</p>
	<p id="IL.18.72">sorrowing for him she spoke to him in winged words: 'Why then,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.73">child, do you lament? What sorrow has come to your heart now?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.74">Speak out, do not hide it. These things are brought to accomplishment</p>
	<p id="IL.18.75">through Zeus: in the way that you lifted your hands and prayed for,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.76">that all the sons of the Achaians be pinned on their grounded vessels</p>
	<p id="IL.18.77">by reason of your loss, and suffer things that are shameful.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.78">Then sighing heavily Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.79">'My mother, all these things the Olympian brought to accomplishment.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.80">But what pleasure is this to me, since my dear companion has perished,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.81">Patroklos, whom I loved beyond all other companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.82">as well as my own life. I have lost him, and Hektor, who killed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.83">has stripped away that gigantic armour, a wonder to look on</p>
	<p id="IL.18.84">and splendid, which the gods gave Peleus, a glorious present,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.85">on that day they drove you to the marriage bed of a mortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.86">I wish you had gone on living then with the other goddesses</p>
	<p id="IL.18.87">of the sea, and that Peleus had married some mortal woman.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.88">As it is, there must be on your heart a numberless sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.18.89">for your son's death, since you can never again receive him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.90">won home again to his country; since the spirit within does not drive me</p>
	<p id="IL.18.91">to go on living and be among men, except on condition</p>
	<p id="IL.18.92">that Hektor first be beaten down under my spear, lose his life</p>
	<p id="IL.18.93">and pay the price for stripping Patroklos, the son of Menoitios.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.94">Then in turn Thetis spoke to him, letting the tears fall:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.95">'Then I must lose you soon, my child, by what you are saying,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.96">since it is decreed your death must come soon after Hektor's.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.97">Then deeply disturbed Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.98">'I must die soon, then; since I was not to stand by my companion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.99">when he was killed. And now, far away from the land of his fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.100">he has perished, and lacked my fighting strength to defend him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.101">Now, since I am not going back to the beloved land of my fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.102">since I was no light of safety to Patroklos, nor to my other</p>
	<p id="IL.18.103">companions, who in their numbers went down before glorious Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.104">but sit here beside my ships, a useless weight on the good land,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.105">I, who am such as no other of the bronze-armoured Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.18.106">in battle, though there are others also better in council--</p>
	<p id="IL.18.107">why, I wish that strife would vanish away from among gods and mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.108">and gall, which makes a man grow angry for all his great mind,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.109">that gall of anger that swarms like smoke inside of a man's heart</p>
	<p id="IL.18.110">and becomes a thing sweeter to him by far than the dripping of honey.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.111">So it was here that the lord of men Agamemnon angered me.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.112">Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, and for all our</p>
	<p id="IL.18.113">sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.114">Now I shall go, to overtake that killer of a dear life,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.115">Hektor; then I will accept my own death, at whatever</p>
	<p id="IL.18.116">time Zeus wishes to bring it about, and the other immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.117">For not even the strength of Herakles fled away from destruction,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.118">although he was dearest of all to lord Zeus, son of Kronos,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.119">but his fate beat him under, and the wearisome anger of Hera.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.120">So I likewise, if such is the fate which has been wrought for me,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.121">shall lie still, when I am dead. Now I must win excellent glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.122">and drive some one of the women of Troy, or some deep-girdled</p>
	<p id="IL.18.123">Dardanian woman, lifting up to her soft cheeks both hands</p>
	<p id="IL.18.124">to wipe away the close bursts of tears in her lamentation,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.125">and learn that I stayed too long out of the fighting. Do not</p>
	<p id="IL.18.126">hold me back from the fight, though you love me. You will not persuade me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.127">In turn the goddess Thetis of the silver feet answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.128">'Yes, it is true, my child, this is no cowardly action,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.129">to beat aside sudden death from your afflicted companions.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.130">Yet, see now, your splendid armour, glaring and brazen,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.131">is held among the Trojans, and Hektor of the shining helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.18.132">wears it on his own shoulders, and glories in it. Yet I think</p>
	<p id="IL.18.133">he will not glory for long, since his death stands very close to him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.134">Therefore do not yet go into the grind of the war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.135">not before with your own eyes you see me come back to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.136">For I am coming to you at dawn and as the sun rises</p>
	<p id="IL.18.137">bringing splendid armour to you from the lord Hephaistos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.138">So she spoke, and turned, and went away from her son,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.139">and turning now to her sisters of the sea she spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.140">'Do you now go back into the wide fold of the water</p>
	<p id="IL.18.141">to visit the ancient of the sea and the house of our father,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.142">and tell him everything. I am going to tall Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.143">and to Hephaistos, the glorious smith, if he might be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.18.144">to give me for my son renowned and radiant armour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.145">She spoke, and they plunged back beneath the wave of the water,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.146">while she the goddess Thetis of the silver feet went onward</p>
	<p id="IL.18.147">to Olympos, to bring back to her son the glorious armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.148">So her feet carried her to Olympos; meanwhile the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.18.149">with inhuman clamour before the attack of manslaughtering Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.18.150">fled until they were making for their own ships and the Hellespont;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.151">nor could the strong-greaved Achaians have dragged the body</p>
	<p id="IL.18.152">of Patroklos, henchman of Achilleus, from under the missiles,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.153">for once again the men and the horses came over upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.154">and Hektor, Priam's son, who fought like a flame in his fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.155">Three times from behind glorious Hektor caught him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.156">by the feet, trying to drag him, and called aloud on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.157">Three times the two Aiantes with their battle-fury upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.158">beat him from the corpse, but he, steady in the confidence of his great strength,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.159">kept making, now a rush into the crowd, or again at another time</p>
	<p id="IL.18.160">stood fast, with his great cry, but gave not a bit of ground backward.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.161">And as herdsmen who dwell in the fields are not able to frighten</p>
	<p id="IL.18.162">a tawny lion in his great hunger away from a carcass,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.163">so the two Aiantes, marshals of men, were not able</p>
	<p id="IL.18.164">to scare Hektor, Priam's son, away from the body.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.165">And now he would have dragged it away and won glory forever</p>
	<p id="IL.18.166">had not swift wind-footed Iris come running from Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.167">with a message for Peleus' son to arm. She came secretly</p>
	<p id="IL.18.168">from Zeus and the other gods, since it was Hera who sent her.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.169">She came and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.170">'Rise up, son of Peleus, most terrifying of all men.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.171">Defend Patroklos, for whose sake the terrible fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.18.172">stands now in front of the ships. They are destroying each other;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.173">the Achaians fight in defence over the fallen body</p>
	<p id="IL.18.174">while the others, the Trojans, are rushing to drag the corpse off</p>
	<p id="IL.18.175">to windy Ilion, and beyond all glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.18.176">rages to haul it away, since the anger within him is urgent</p>
	<p id="IL.18.177">to cut the head from the soft neck and set it on sharp stakes.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.178">Up, then, lie here no longer; let shame come into your heart, lest</p>
	<p id="IL.18.179">Patroklos become sport for the dogs of Troy to worry,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.180">your shame, if the body goes from here with defilement upon it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.181">Then in turn Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.182">'Divine Iris, what god sent you to me with a message?'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.183">Then in turn swift wind-footed Iris spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.184">'Hera sent me, the honoured wife of Zeus; but the son of</p>
	<p id="IL.18.185">Kronos, who sits on high, does not know this, nor any other</p>
	<p id="IL.18.186">immortal, of all those who dwell by the snows of Olympos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.187">Then in answer to her spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.188">'How shall I go into the fighting? They have my armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.189">And my beloved mother told me I must not be armoured,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.190">not before with my own eyes I see her come back to me.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.191">She promised she would bring magnificent arms from Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.192">Nor do I know of another whose glorious armour I could wear</p>
	<p id="IL.18.193">unless it were the great shield of Telamonian Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.194">But he himself wears it, I think, and goes in the foremost</p>
	<p id="IL.18.195">of the spear-fight over the body of fallen Patroklos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.196">Then in turn swift wind-footed Iris spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.197">'Yes, we also know well how they hold your glorious armour.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.198">But go to the ditch, and show yourself as you are to the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.199">if perhaps the Trojans might be frightened, and give way</p>
	<p id="IL.18.200">from their attack, and the fighting sons of the Achaians get wind</p>
	<p id="IL.18.201">again after hard work. There is little breathing space in the fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.202">So speaking Iris of the swift feet went away from him;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.203">but Achilleus, the beloved of Zeus, rose up, and Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.18.204">swept about his powerful shoulders the fluttering aegis;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.205">and she, the divine among goddesses, about his head circled</p>
	<p id="IL.18.206">a golden cloud, and kindled from it a flame far-shining.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.207">As when a flare goes up into the high air from a city</p>
	<p id="IL.18.208">from an island far away, with enemies fighting about it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.209">who all day long are in the hateful division of Ares</p>
	<p id="IL.18.210">fighting from their own city, but as the sun goes down signal</p>
	<p id="IL.18.211">fires blaze out one after another, so that the glare goes</p>
	<p id="IL.18.212">pulsing high for men of the neighbouring islands to see it,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.213">in case they might come over in ships to beat off the enemy;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.214">so from the head of Achilleus the blaze shot into the bright air.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.215">He went from the wall and stood by the ditch, nor mixed with the other</p>
	<p id="IL.18.216">Achaians, since he followed the close command of his mother.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.217">There he stood, and shouted, and from her place Pallas Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.18.218">gave cry, and drove an endless terror upon the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.219">As loud as comes the voice that is screamed out by a trumpet</p>
	<p id="IL.18.220">by murderous attackers who beleaguer a city,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.221">so then high and clear went up the voice of Aiakides.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.222">But the Trojans, when they heard the brazen voice of Aiakides,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.223">the heart was shaken in all, and the very floating-maned horses</p>
	<p id="IL.18.224">turned their chariots about, since their hearts saw the coming afflictions.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.225">The charioteers were dumbfounded as they saw the unwearied dangerous</p>
	<p id="IL.18.226">fire that played above the head of great-hearted Peleion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.227">blazing, and kindled by the goddess grey-eyed Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.228">Three times across the ditch brilliant Achilleus gave his great cry,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.229">and three times the Trojans and their renowned companions were routed.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.230">There at that time twelve of the best men among them perished</p>
	<p id="IL.18.231">upon their own chariots and spears. Meanwhile the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.18.232">gladly pulled Patroklos out from under the missiles</p>
	<p id="IL.18.233">and set him upon a litter, and his own companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.234">stood mourning, and along with them swift-footed Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.18.235">went, letting fall warm tears as he saw his steadfast companion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.236">lying there on a carried litter and torn with the sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.237">the man he had sent off before with horses and chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.18.238">into the fighting; who never again came home to be welcomed.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.239">Now the lady Hera of the ox eyes drove the unwilling</p>
	<p id="IL.18.240">weariless sun god to sink in the depth of the Ocean,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.241">and the sun went down, and the brilliant Achaians gave over</p>
	<p id="IL.18.242">their strong fighting, and the doubtful collision of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.243">The Trojans on the other side moved from the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.18.244">in their turn, and unyoked their running horses from under the chariots,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.245">and gathered into assembly before taking thought for their supper.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.246">They stood on their feet in assembly, nor did any man have the patience</p>
	<p id="IL.18.247">to sit down, but the terror was on them all, seeing that Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.18.248">had appeared, after he had stayed so long from the difficult fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.249">First to speak among them was the careful Poulydamas,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.250">Panthoös' son, who alone of them looked before and behind him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.251">He was companion to Hektor, and born on the same night with him,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.252">but he was better in words, the other with the spear far better.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.253">He in kind intention toward all stood forth and addressed them:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.254">'Now take careful thought, dear friends; for I myself urge you</p>
	<p id="IL.18.255">to go back into the city and not wait for the divine dawn</p>
	<p id="IL.18.256">in the plain beside the ships. We are too far from the wall now.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.257">While this man was still angry with great Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.258">for all that time the Achaians were easier men to fight with.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.259">For I also used then to be one who was glad to sleep out</p>
	<p id="IL.18.260">near their ships, and I hoped to capture the oarswept vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.261">But now I terribly dread the swift-footed son of Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.262">So violent is the valour in him, he will not be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.18.263">to stay here in the plain, where now Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.18.264">from either side sunder between them the wrath of the war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.265">With him, the fight will be for the sake of our city and women.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.266">Let us go into the town; believe me; thus it will happen.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.267">For this present, immortal night has stopped the swift-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.18.268">son of Peleus, but if he catches us still in this place</p>
	<p id="IL.18.269">tomorrow, and drives upon us in arms, a man will be well</p>
	<p id="IL.18.270">aware of him, be glad to get back into sacred Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.271">the man who escapes; there will be many Trojans the vultures</p>
	<p id="IL.18.272">and dogs will feed on. But let such a word be out of my hearing!</p>
	<p id="IL.18.273">If all of us will do as I say, though it hurts us to do it,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.274">this night we will hold our strength in the market place, and the great walls</p>
	<p id="IL.18.275">and the gateways, and the long, smooth-planed, close-joined gate timbers</p>
	<p id="IL.18.276">that close to fit them shall defend our city. Then, early</p>
	<p id="IL.18.277">in the morning, under dawn, we shall arm ourselves in our war gear</p>
	<p id="IL.18.278">and take stations along the walls. The worse for him, if he endeavours</p>
	<p id="IL.18.279">to come away from the ships and fight us here for our city.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.280">Back he must go to his ships again, when he wears out the strong necks</p>
	<p id="IL.18.281">of his horses, driving them at a gallop everywhere by the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.282">His valour will not give him leave to burst in upon us</p>
	<p id="IL.18.283">nor sack our town. Sooner the circling dogs will feed on him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.284">Then looking darkly at him Hektor of the shining helm spoke:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.285">'Poulydamas, these things that you argue please me no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.18.286">when you tell us to go back again and be cooped in our city.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.287">Have you not all had your glut of being fenced in our outworks?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.288">There was a time when mortal men would speak of the city</p>
	<p id="IL.18.289">of Priam as a place with much gold and much bronze. But now</p>
	<p id="IL.18.290">the lovely treasures that lay away in our houses have vanished,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.291">and many possessions have been sold and gone into Phrygia</p>
	<p id="IL.18.292">and into Maionia the lovely, when great Zeus was angry.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.293">But now, when the son of devious-devising Kronos has given</p>
	<p id="IL.18.294">me the winning of glory by the ships, to pin the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.18.295">on the sea, why, fool, no longer show these thoughts to our people.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.296">Not one of the Trojans will obey you. I shall not allow it.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.297">Come, then, do as I say and let us all be persuaded.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.298">Now, take your supper by positions along the encampment,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.299">and do not forget your watch, and let every man be wakeful.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.300">And if any Trojan is strongly concerned about his possessions,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.301">let him gather them and give them to the people, to use them in common.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.302">It is better for one of us to enjoy them than for the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.303">In the morning, under dawn, we shall arm ourselves in our war gear</p>
	<p id="IL.18.304">and waken the bitter god of war by the hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.305">If it is true that brilliant Achilleus is risen beside their</p>
	<p id="IL.18.306">ships, then the worse for him if he tries it, since I for my part</p>
	<p id="IL.18.307">will not run from him out of the sorrowful battle, but rather</p>
	<p id="IL.18.308">stand fast, to see if he wins the great glory, or if I can win it.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.309">The war god is impartial. Before now he has killed the killer.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.310">So spoke Hektor, and the Trojans thundered to hear him;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.311">fools, since Pallas Athene had taken away the wits from them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.312">They gave their applause to Hektor in his counsel of evil,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.313">but none to Poulydamas, who had spoken good sense before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.314">They took their supper along the encampment. Meanwhile the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.18.315">mourned all night in lamentation over Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.316">Peleus' son led the thronging chant of their lamentation,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.317">and laid his manslaughtering hands over the chest of his dear friend</p>
	<p id="IL.18.318">with outbursts of incessant grief. As some great bearded lion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.319">when some man, a deer hunter, has stolen his cubs away from him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.320">out of the close wood; the lion comes back too late, and is anguished,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.321">and turns into many valleys quartering after the man's trail</p>
	<p id="IL.18.322">on the chance of finding him, and taken with bitter anger;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.323">so he, groaning heavily, spoke out to the Myrmidons:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.324">'Ah me. It was an empty word I cast forth on that day</p>
	<p id="IL.18.325">when in his halls I tried to comfort the hero Menoitios.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.326">I told him I would bring back his son in glory to Opous</p>
	<p id="IL.18.327">with Ilion sacked, and bringing his share of war spoils allotted.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.328">But Zeus does not bring to accomplishment all thoughts in men's minds.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.329">Thus it is destiny for us both to stain the same soil</p>
	<p id="IL.18.330">here in Troy; since I shall never come home, and my father,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.331">Peleus the aged rider, will not welcome me in his great house,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.332">nor Thetis my mother, but in this place the earth will receive me.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.333">But seeing that it is I, Patroklos, who follow you underground,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.334">I will not bury you till I bring to this place the armour</p>
	<p id="IL.18.335">and the head of Hektor, since he was your great-hearted murderer.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.336">Before your burning pyre I shall behead twelve glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.18.337">children of the Trojans, for my anger over your slaying.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.338">Until then, you shall lie where you are in front of my curved ships</p>
	<p id="IL.18.339">and beside you women of Troy and deep-girdled Dardanian women</p>
	<p id="IL.18.340">shall sorrow for you night and day and shed tears for you, those whom</p>
	<p id="IL.18.341">you and I worked hard to capture by force and the long spear</p>
	<p id="IL.18.342">in days when we were storming the rich cities of mortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.343">So speaking brilliant Achilleus gave orders to his companions</p>
	<p id="IL.18.344">to set a great cauldron across the fire, so that with all speed</p>
	<p id="IL.18.345">they could wash away the clotted blood from Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.346">They set up over the blaze of the fire a bath-water cauldron</p>
	<p id="IL.18.347">and poured water into it and put logs underneath and kindled them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.348">The fire worked on the swell of the cauldron, and the water heated.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.349">But when the water had come to a boil in the shining bronze, then</p>
	<p id="IL.18.350">they washed the body and anointed it softly with olive oil</p>
	<p id="IL.18.351">and stopped the gashes in his body with stored-up unguents</p>
	<p id="IL.18.352">and laid him on a bed, and shrouded him in a thin sheet</p>
	<p id="IL.18.353">from head to foot, and covered that over with a white mantle.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.354">Then all night long, gathered about Achilleus of the swift feet,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.355">the Myrmidons mourned for Patroklos and lamented over him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.356">But Zeus spoke to Hera, who was his wife and his sister:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.357">'So you have acted, then, lady Hera of the ox eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.358">You have roused up Achilleus of the swift feet. It must be then</p>
	<p id="IL.18.359">that the flowing-haired Achaians are born of your own generation.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.360">Then the goddess the ox-eyed lady Hera answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.361">'Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.362">Even one who is mortal will try to accomplish his purpose</p>
	<p id="IL.18.363">for another, though he be a man and knows not such wisdom as we do.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.364">As for me then, who claim I am highest of all the goddesses,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.365">both ways, since I am eldest born and am called your consort,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.366">yours, and you in turn are lord over all the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.367">how could I not weave sorrows for the men of Troy, when I hate them?'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.368">Now as these two were saying things like this to each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.369">Thetis of the silver feet came to the house of Hephaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.370">imperishable, starry, and shining among the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.371">built in bronze for himself by the god of the dragging footsteps.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.372">She found him sweating as he turned here and there to his bellows</p>
	<p id="IL.18.373">busily, since he was working on twenty tripods</p>
	<p id="IL.18.374">which were to stand against the wall of his strong-founded dwelling.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.375">And he had set golden wheels underneath the base of each one</p>
	<p id="IL.18.376">so that of their own motion they could wheel into the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.18.377">gathering, and return to his house: a wonder to look at.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.378">These were so far finished, but the elaborate ear handles</p>
	<p id="IL.18.379">were not yet on. He was forging these, and beating the chains out.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.380">As he was at work on this in his craftsmanship and his cunning</p>
	<p id="IL.18.381">meanwhile the goddess Thetis the silver-footed drew near him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.382">Charis of the shining veil saw her as she came forward,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.383">she, the lovely goddess the renowned strong-armed one had married.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.384">She came, and caught her hand and called her by name and spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.385">'Why is it, Thetis of the light robes, you have come to our house now?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.386">We honour you and love you; but you have not come much before this.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.387">But come in with me, so I may put entertainment before you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.388">She spoke, and, shining among divinities, led the way forward</p>
	<p id="IL.18.389">and made Thetis sit down in a chair that was wrought elaborately</p>
	<p id="IL.18.390">and splendid with silver nails, and under it was a footstool.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.391">She called to Hephaistos the renowned smith and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.392">'Hephaistos, come this way; here is Thetis, who has need of you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.393">Hearing her the renowned smith of the strong arms answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.394">'Then there is a goddess we honour and respect in our house.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.395">She saved me when I suffered much at the time of my great fall</p>
	<p id="IL.18.396">through the will of my own brazen-faced mother, who wanted</p>
	<p id="IL.18.397">to hide me, for being lame. Then my soul would have taken much suffering</p>
	<p id="IL.18.398">had not Eurynome and Thetis caught me and held me,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.399">Eurynome, daughter of Ocean, whose stream bends back in a circle.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.400">With them I worked nine years as a smith, and wrought many intricate</p>
	<p id="IL.18.401">things; pins that bend back, curved clasps, cups, necklaces, working</p>
	<p id="IL.18.402">there in the hollow of the cave, and the stream of Ocean around us</p>
	<p id="IL.18.403">went on forever with its foam and its murmur. No other</p>
	<p id="IL.18.404">among the gods or among mortal men knew about us</p>
	<p id="IL.18.405">except Eurynome and Thetis. They knew, since they saved me.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.406">Now she has come into our house; so I must by all means</p>
	<p id="IL.18.407">do everything to give recompense to lovely-haired Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.18.408">for my life. Therefore set out before her fair entertainment</p>
	<p id="IL.18.409">while I am putting away my bellows and all my instruments.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.410">He spoke, and took the huge blower off from the block of the anvil</p>
	<p id="IL.18.411">limping; and yet his shrunken legs moved lightly beneath him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.412">He set the bellows away from the fire, and gathered and put away</p>
	<p id="IL.18.413">all the tools with which he worked in a silver strongbox.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.414">Then with a sponge he wiped clean his forehead, and both hands,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.415">and his massive neck and hairy chest, and put on a tunic,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.416">and took up a heavy stick in his hand, and went to the doorway</p>
	<p id="IL.18.417">limping. And in support of their master moved his attendants.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.418">These are golden, and in appearance like living young women.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.419">There is intelligence in their hearts, and there is speech in them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.420">and strength, and from the immortal gods they have learned how to do things.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.421">These stirred nimbly in support of their master, and moving</p>
	<p id="IL.18.422">near to where Thetis sat in her shining chair, Hephaistos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.423">caught her by the hand and called her by name and spoke a word to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.424">'Why is it, Thetis of the light robes, you have come to our house now?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.425">We honour you and love you; but you have not come much before this.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.426">Speak forth what is in your mind. My heart is urgent to do it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.427">if I can, and if it is a thing that can be accomplished.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.428">Then in turn Thetis answered him, letting the tears fall:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.429">'Hephaistos, is there among all the goddesses on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.430">one who in her heart has endured so many grim sorrows</p>
	<p id="IL.18.431">as the griefs Zeus, son of Kronos, has given me beyond others?</p>
	<p id="IL.18.432">Of all the other sisters of the sea he gave me to a mortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.433">to Peleus, Aiakos' son, and I had to endure mortal marriage</p>
	<p id="IL.18.434">though much against my will. And now he, broken by mournful</p>
	<p id="IL.18.435">old age, lies away in his halls. Yet I have other troubles.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.436">For since he has given me a son to bear and to raise up</p>
	<p id="IL.18.437">conspicuous among heroes, and he shot up like a young tree,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.438">I nurtured him, like a tree grown in the pride of the orchard.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.439">I sent him away in the curved ships to the land of Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.440">to fight with the Trojans; but I shall never again receive him</p>
	<p id="IL.18.441">won home again to his country and into the house of Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.442">Yet while I see him live and he looks on the sunlight, he has</p>
	<p id="IL.18.443">sorrows, and though I go to him I can do nothing to help him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.444">And the girl the sons of the Achaians chose out for his honour</p>
	<p id="IL.18.445">powerful Agamemnon took her away again out of his hands.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.446">For her his heart has been wasting in sorrow; but meanwhile the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.18.447">pinned the Achaians against their grounded ships, and would not</p>
	<p id="IL.18.448">let them win outside, and the elders of the Argives entreated</p>
	<p id="IL.18.449">my son, and named the many glorious gifts they would give him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.450">But at that time he refused himself to fight the death from them;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.451">nevertheless he put his own armour upon Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.452">and sent him into the fighting, and gave many men to go with him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.453">All day they fought about the Skaian Gates, and on that day</p>
	<p id="IL.18.454">they would have stormed the city, if only Phoibos Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.18.455">had not killed the fighting son of Menoitios there in the first ranks</p>
	<p id="IL.18.456">after he had wrought much damage, and given the glory to Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.457">Therefore now I come to your knees; so might you be willing</p>
	<p id="IL.18.458">to give me for my short-lived son a shield and a helmet</p>
	<p id="IL.18.459">and two beautiful greaves fitted with clasps for the ankles</p>
	<p id="IL.18.460">and a corselet. What he had was lost with his steadfast companion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.461">when the Trojans killed him. Now my son lies on the ground, heart sorrowing.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.462">Hearing her the renowned smith of the strong arms answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.18.463">'Do not fear. Let not these things be a thought in your mind.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.464">And I wish that I could hide him away from death and its sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.18.465">at that time when his hard fate comes upon him, as surely</p>
	<p id="IL.18.466">as there shall be fine armour for him, such as another</p>
	<p id="IL.18.467">man out of many men shall wonder at, when he looks on it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.18.468">So he spoke, and left her there, and went to his bellows.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.469">He turned these toward the fire and gave them their orders for working.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.470">And the bellows, all twenty of them, blew on the crucibles,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.471">from all directions blasting forth wind to blow the flames high</p>
	<p id="IL.18.472">now as he hurried to be at this place and now at another,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.473">wherever Hephaistos might wish them to blow, and the work went forward.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.474">He cast on the fire bronze which is weariless, and tin with it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.475">and valuable gold, and silver, and thereafter set forth</p>
	<p id="IL.18.476">upon its standard the great anvil, and gripped in one hand</p>
	<p id="IL.18.477">the ponderous hammer, while in the other he grasped the pincers.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.478">First of all he forged a shield that was huge and heavy,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.479">elaborating it about, and threw around it a shining</p>
	<p id="IL.18.480">triple rim that glittered, and the shield strap was cast of silver.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.481">There were five folds composing the shield itself, and upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.482">he elaborated many things in his skill and craftsmanship.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.483">He made the earth upon it, and the sky, and the sea's water,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.484">and the tireless sun, and the moon waxing into her fullness,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.485">and on it all the constellations that festoon the heavens,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.486">the Pleiades and the Hyades and the strength of Orion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.487">and the Bear, whom men give also the name of the Wagon,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.488">who turns about in a fixed place and looks at Orion</p>
	<p id="IL.18.489">and she alone is never plunged in the wash of the Ocean.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.490">On it he wrought in all their beauty two cities of mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.18.491">men. And there were marriages in one, and festivals.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.492">They were leading the brides along the city from their maiden chambers</p>
	<p id="IL.18.493">under the flaring of torches, and the loud bride song was arising.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.494">The young men followed the circles of the dance, and among them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.495">the flutes and lyres kept up their clamour as in the meantime</p>
	<p id="IL.18.496">the women standing each at the door of her court admired them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.497">The people were assembled in the market place, where a quarrel</p>
	<p id="IL.18.498">had arisen, and two men were disputing over the blood price</p>
	<p id="IL.18.499">for a man who had been killed. One man promised full restitution</p>
	<p id="IL.18.500">in a public statement, but the other refused and would accept nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.501">Both then made for an arbitrator, to have a decision;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.502">and people were speaking up on either side, to help both men.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.503">But the heralds kept the people in hand, as meanwhile the elders</p>
	<p id="IL.18.504">were in session on benches of polished stone in the sacred circle</p>
	<p id="IL.18.505">and held in their hands the staves of the heralds who lift their voices.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.506">The two men rushed before these, and took turns speaking their cases,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.507">and between them lay on the ground two talents of gold, to be given</p>
	<p id="IL.18.508">to that judge who in this case spoke the straightest opinion.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.509">But around the other city were lying two forces of armed men</p>
	<p id="IL.18.510">shining in their war gear. For one side counsel was divided</p>
	<p id="IL.18.511">whether to storm and sack, or share between both sides the property</p>
	<p id="IL.18.512">and all the possessions the lovely citadel held hard within it.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.513">But the city's people were not giving way, and armed for an ambush.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.514">Their beloved wives and their little children stood on the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.18.515">to hold it, and with them the men with age upon them, but meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.18.516">the others went out. And Ares led them, and Pallas Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.517">These were gold, both, and golden raiment upon them, and they were</p>
	<p id="IL.18.518">beautiful and huge in their armour, being divinities,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.519">and conspicuous from afar, but the people around them were smaller.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.520">These, when they were come to the place that was set for their ambush,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.521">in a river, where there was a watering place for all animals,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.522">there they sat down in place shrouding themselves in the bright bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.523">But apart from these were sitting two men to watch for the rest of them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.524">and waiting until they could see the sheep and the shambling cattle,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.525">who appeared presently, and two herdsmen went along with them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.526">playing happily on pipes, and took no thought of the treachery.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.527">Those others saw them, and made a rush, and quickly thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.18.528">cut off on both sides the herds of cattle and the beautiful</p>
	<p id="IL.18.529">flocks of shining sheep, and killed the shepherds upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.530">But the other army, as soon as they heard the uproar arising</p>
	<p id="IL.18.531">from the cattle, as they sat in their councils, suddenly mounted</p>
	<p id="IL.18.532">behind their light-foot horses, and went after, and soon overtook them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.533">These stood their ground and fought a battle by the banks of the river,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.534">and they were making casts at each other with their spears bronze-headed;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.535">and Hate was there with Confusion among them, and Death the destructive;</p>
	<p id="IL.18.536">she was holding a live man with a new wound, and another</p>
	<p id="IL.18.537">one unhurt, and dragged a dead man by the feet through the carnage.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.538">The clothing upon her shoulders showed strong red with the men's blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.539">All closed together like living men and fought with each other</p>
	<p id="IL.18.540">and dragged away from each other the corpses of those who had fallen.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.541">He made upon it a soft field, the pride of the tilled land,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.542">wide and triple-ploughed, with many ploughmen upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.543">who wheeled their teams at the turn and drove them in either direction.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.544">And as these making their turn would reach the end-strip of the field,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.545">a man would come up to them at this point and hand them a flagon</p>
	<p id="IL.18.546">of honey-sweet wine, and they would turn again to the furrows</p>
	<p id="IL.18.547">in their haste to come again to the end-strip of the deep field.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.548">The earth darkened behind them and looked like earth that has been ploughed</p>
	<p id="IL.18.549">though it was gold. Such was the wonder of the shield's forging.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.550">He made on it the precinct of a king, where the labourers</p>
	<p id="IL.18.551">were reaping, with the sharp reaping hooks in their hands. Of the cut swathes</p>
	<p id="IL.18.552">some fell along the lines of reaping, one after another,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.553">while the sheaf-binders caught up others and tied them with bind-ropes.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.554">There were three sheaf-binders who stood by, and behind them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.555">were children picking up the cut swathes, and filled their arms with them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.556">and carried and gave them always; and by them the king in silence</p>
	<p id="IL.18.557">and holding his staff stood near the line of the reapers, happily.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.558">And apart and under a tree the heralds made a feast ready</p>
	<p id="IL.18.559">and trimmed a great ox they had slaughtered. Meanwhile the women</p>
	<p id="IL.18.560">scattered, for the workmen to eat, abundant white barley.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.561">He made on it a great vineyard heavy with clusters,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.562">lovely and in gold, but the grapes upon it were darkened</p>
	<p id="IL.18.563">and the vines themselves stood out through poles of silver. About them</p>
	<p id="IL.18.564">he made a field-ditch of dark metal, and drove all around this</p>
	<p id="IL.18.565">a fence of tin; and there was only one path to the vineyard,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.566">and along it ran the grape-bearers for the vineyard's stripping.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.567">Young girls and young men, in all their light-hearted innocence,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.568">carried the kind, sweet fruit away in their woven baskets,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.569">and in their midst a youth with a singing lyre played charmingly</p>
	<p id="IL.18.570">upon it for them, and sang the beautiful song for Linos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.571">in a light voice, and they followed him, and with singing and whistling</p>
	<p id="IL.18.572">and light dance-steps of their feet kept time to the music.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.573">He made upon it a herd of horn-straight oxen. The cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.18.574">were wrought of gold and of tin, and thronged in speed and with lowing</p>
	<p id="IL.18.575">out of the dung of the farmyard to a pasturing place by a sounding</p>
	<p id="IL.18.576">river, and beside the moving field of a reed bed.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.577">The herdsmen were of gold who went along with the cattle,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.578">four of them, and nine dogs shifting their feet followed them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.579">But among the foremost of the cattle two formidable lions</p>
	<p id="IL.18.580">had caught hold of a bellowing bull, and he with loud lowings</p>
	<p id="IL.18.581">was dragged away, as the dogs and the young men went in pursuit of him.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.582">But the two lions, breaking open the hide of the great ox,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.583">gulped the black blood and the inward guts, as meanwhile the herdsmen</p>
	<p id="IL.18.584">were in the act of setting and urging the quick dogs on them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.585">But they, before they could get their teeth in, turned back from the lions,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.586">but would come and take their stand very close, and bayed, and kept clear.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.587">And the renowned smith of the strong arms made on it a meadow</p>
	<p id="IL.18.588">large and in a lovely valley for the glimmering sheepflocks,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.589">with dwelling places upon it, and covered shelters, and sheepfolds.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.590">And the renowned smith of the strong arms made elaborate on it</p>
	<p id="IL.18.591">a dancing floor, like that which once in the wide spaces of Knosos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.592">Daidalos built for Ariadne of the lovely tresses.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.593">And there were young men on it and young girls, sought for their beauty</p>
	<p id="IL.18.594">with gifts of oxen, dancing, and holding hands at the wrist. These</p>
	<p id="IL.18.595">wore, the maidens long light robes, but the men wore tunics</p>
	<p id="IL.18.596">of finespun work and shining softly, touched with olive oil.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.597">And the girls wore fair garlands on their heads, while the young men</p>
	<p id="IL.18.598">carried golden knives that hung from sword-belts of silver.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.599">At whiles on their understanding feet they would run very lightly,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.600">as when a potter crouching makes trial of his wheel, holding</p>
	<p id="IL.18.601">it close in his hands, to see if it will run smooth. At another</p>
	<p id="IL.18.602">time they would form rows, and run, rows crossing each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.603">And around the lovely chorus of dancers stood a great multitude</p>
	<p id="IL.18.604">happily watching. And among them sang an inspired singer</p>
	<p id="IL.18.605">playing his lyre, while with them two acrobats</p>
	<p id="IL.18.606">led the measures of song and dance revolving among them.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.607">He made on it the great strength of the Ocean River</p>
	<p id="IL.18.608">which ran around the uttermost rim of the shield's strong structure.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.609">Then after he had wrought this shield, which was huge and heavy,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.610">he wrought for him a corselet brighter than fire in its shining,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.611">and wrought him a helmet, massive and fitting close to his temples,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.612">lovely and intricate work, and laid a gold top-ridge along it,</p>
	<p id="IL.18.613">and out of pliable tin wrought him leg-armour. Thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.18.614">when the renowned smith of the strong arms had finished the armour</p>
	<p id="IL.18.615">he lifted it and laid it before the mother of Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.18.616">And she like a hawk came sweeping down from the snows of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.18.617">and carried with her the shining armour, the gift of Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.1">Now Dawn the yellow-robed arose from the river of Ocean</p>
	<p id="IL.19.2">to carry her light to men and to immortals. And Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.19.3">came to the ships and carried with her the gifts of Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.4">She found her beloved son lying in the arms of Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.19.5">crying shrill, and his companions in their numbers about him</p>
	<p id="IL.19.6">mourned. She, shining among divinities, stood there beside them.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.7">She clung to her son's hand and called him by name and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.8">'My child, now, though we grieve for him, we must let this man lie</p>
	<p id="IL.19.9">dead, in the way he first was killed through the gods' designing.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.10">Accept rather from me the glorious arms of Hephaistos,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.11">so splendid, and such as no man has ever worn on his shoulders.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.12">The goddess spoke so, and set down the armour on the ground</p>
	<p id="IL.19.13">before Achilleus, and all its elaboration clashed loudly.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.14">Trembling took hold of all the Myrmidons. None had the courage</p>
	<p id="IL.19.15">to look straight at it. They were afraid of it. Only Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.16">looked, and as he looked the anger came harder upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.19.17">and his eyes glittered terribly under his lids, like sunflare.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.18">He was glad, holding in his hands the shining gifts of Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.19">But when he had satisfied his heart with looking at the intricate</p>
	<p id="IL.19.20">armour, he spoke to his mother and addressed her in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.21">'My mother, the god has given me these weapons; they are such</p>
	<p id="IL.19.22">as are the work of immortals. No mortal man could have made them.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.23">Therefore now I shall arm myself in them. Yet I am sadly</p>
	<p id="IL.19.24">afraid, during this time, for the warlike son of Menoitios</p>
	<p id="IL.19.25">that flies might get into the wounds beaten by bronze in his body</p>
	<p id="IL.19.26">and breed worms in them, and these make foul the body, seeing</p>
	<p id="IL.19.27">that the life is killed in him, and that all his flesh may be rotted.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.28">In turn the goddess Thetis the silver-footed answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.29">'My child, no longer let these things be a care in your mind.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.30">I shall endeavour to drive from him the swarming and fierce things,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.31">those flies, which feed upon the bodies of men who have perished;</p>
	<p id="IL.19.32">and although he lie here till a year has gone to fulfilment,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.33">still his body shall be as it was, or firmer than ever.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.34">Go then and summon into assembly the fighting Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.35">and unsay your anger against Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.36">and arm at once for the fighting, and put your war strength upon you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.37">She spoke so, and drove the strength of great courage into him;</p>
	<p id="IL.19.38">and meanwhile through the nostrils of Patroklos she distilled</p>
	<p id="IL.19.39">ambrosia and red nectar, so that his flesh might not spoil.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.40">But he, brilliant Achilleus, walked along by the sea-shore</p>
	<p id="IL.19.41">crying his terrible cry, and stirred up the fighting Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.42">And even those who before had stayed where the ships were assembled,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.43">they who were helmsmen of the ships and handled the steering oar,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.44">they who were stewards among the ships and dispensers of rations,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.45">even these came then to assembly, since now Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.46">had appeared, after staying so long from the sorrowful battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.47">And there were two who came limping among them, henchmen of Ares</p>
	<p id="IL.19.48">both, Tydeus' son the staunch in battle, and brilliant Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.49">leaning on spears, since they had the pain of their wounds yet upon them,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.50">and came and took their seats in the front rank of those assembled.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.51">And last of them came in the lord of men Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.19.52">with a wound on him, seeing that Koön, the son of Antenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.53">had stabbed him with the bronze edge of the spear in the strong encounter.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.54">But now, when all the Achaians were in one body together,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.55">Achilleus of the swift feet stood up before them and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.56">'Son of Atreus, was this after all the better way for</p>
	<p id="IL.19.57">both, for you and me, that we, for all our hearts' sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.58">quarrelled together for the sake of a girl in soul-perishing hatred?</p>
	<p id="IL.19.59">I wish Artemis had killed her beside the ships with an arrow</p>
	<p id="IL.19.60">on that day when I destroyed Lyrnessos and took her.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.61">For thus not all these too many Achaians would have bitten</p>
	<p id="IL.19.62">the dust, by enemy hands, when I was away in my anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.63">This way was better for the Trojans and Hektor; yet I think</p>
	<p id="IL.19.64">the Achaians will too long remember this quarrel between us.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.65">Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, though it hurts us,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.66">and beat down by constraint the anger that rises inside us.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.67">Now I am making an end of my anger. It does not become me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.68">unrelentingly to rage on. Come, then! The more quickly</p>
	<p id="IL.19.69">drive on the flowing-haired Achaians into the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.70">so that I may go up against the Trojans, and find out</p>
	<p id="IL.19.71">if they still wish to sleep out beside the ships. I think rather</p>
	<p id="IL.19.72">they will be glad to rest where they are, whoever among them</p>
	<p id="IL.19.73">gets away with his life from the fury of our spears' onset.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.74">He spoke, and the strong-greaved Achaians were pleasured to hear him</p>
	<p id="IL.19.75">and how the great-hearted son of Peleus unsaid his anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.76">Now among them spoke forth the lord of men Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.19.77">from the place where he was sitting, and did not stand up among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.78">'Fighting men and friends, o Danaans, henchmen of Ares:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.79">it is well to listen to the speaker, it is not becoming</p>
	<p id="IL.19.80">to break in on him. This will be hard for him, though he be able.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.81">How among the great murmur of people shall anyone listen</p>
	<p id="IL.19.82">or speak either? A man, though he speak very clearly, is baffled.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.83">I shall address the son of Peleus; yet all you other</p>
	<p id="IL.19.84">Argives listen also, and give my word careful attention.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.85">This is the word the Achaians have spoken often against me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.86">and found fault with me in it, yet I am not responsible</p>
	<p id="IL.19.87">but Zeus is, and Destiny, and Erinys the mist-walking</p>
	<p id="IL.19.88">who in assembly caught my heart in the savage delusion</p>
	<p id="IL.19.89">on that day I myself stripped from him the prize of Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.90">Yet what could I do? It is the god who accomplishes all things.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.91">Delusion is the elder daughter of Zeus, the accursed</p>
	<p id="IL.19.92">who deludes all; her feet are delicate and they step not</p>
	<p id="IL.19.93">on the firm earth, but she walks the air above men's heads</p>
	<p id="IL.19.94">and leads them astray. She has entangled others before me.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.95">Yes, for once Zeus even was deluded, though men say</p>
	<p id="IL.19.96">he is the highest one of gods and mortals. Yet Hera</p>
	<p id="IL.19.97">who is female deluded even Zeus in her craftiness</p>
	<p id="IL.19.98">on that day when in strong wall-circled Thebe Alkmene</p>
	<p id="IL.19.99">was at her time to bring forth the strength of Herakles. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.19.100">Zeus spoke forth and made a vow before all the immortals:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.101">"Hear me, all you gods and all you goddesses: hear me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.102">while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.103">This day Eileithyia of women's child-pains shall bring forth</p>
	<p id="IL.19.104">a man to the light who, among the men sprung of the generation</p>
	<p id="IL.19.105">of my blood, shall be lord over all those dwelling about him."</p>
	<p id="IL.19.106">Then in guileful intention the lady Hera said to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.107">"You will be a liar, not put fulfilment on what you have spoken.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.108">Come, then, lord of Olympos, and swear before me a strong oath</p>
	<p id="IL.19.109">that he shall be lord over all those dwelling about him</p>
	<p id="IL.19.110">who this day shall fall between the feet of a woman,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.111">that man who is born of the blood of your generation." So Hera</p>
	<p id="IL.19.112">spoke. And Zeus was entirely unaware of her falsehood,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.113">but swore a great oath, and therein lay all his deception.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.114">But Hera in a flash of speed left the horn of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.19.115">and rapidly came to Argos of Achaia, where she knew</p>
	<p id="IL.19.116">was the mighty wife of Sthenelos, descended of Perseus.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.117">And she was carrying a son, and this was the seventh month for her,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.118">but she brought him sooner into the light, and made him premature,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.119">and stayed the childbirth of Alkmene, and held back the birth pangs.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.120">She went herself and spoke the message to Zeus, son of Kronos:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.121">"Father Zeus of the shining bolt, I will tell you a message</p>
	<p id="IL.19.122">for your heart. A great man is born, who will be lord over the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.123">Eurystheus, son of Sthenelos, of the seed of Perseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.124">your generation. It is not unfit that he should rule over</p>
	<p id="IL.19.125">the Argives." She spoke, and the sharp sorrow struck at his deep heart.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.126">He caught by the shining hair of her head the goddess Delusion</p>
	<p id="IL.19.127">in the anger of his heart, and swore a strong oath, that never</p>
	<p id="IL.19.128">after this might Delusion, who deludes all, come back</p>
	<p id="IL.19.129">to Olympos and the starry sky. So speaking, he whirled her</p>
	<p id="IL.19.130">about in his hand and slung her out of the starry heaven,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.131">and presently she came to men's establishments. But Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.132">would forever grieve over her each time that he saw his dear son</p>
	<p id="IL.19.133">doing some shameful work of the tasks that Eurystheus set him.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.134">So I in my time, when tall Hektor of the shining helm</p>
	<p id="IL.19.135">was forever destroying the Argives against the sterns of their vessels,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.136">could not forget Delusion, the way I was first deluded.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.137">But since I was deluded and Zeus took my wits away from me,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.138">I am willing to make all good and give back gifts in abundance.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.139">Rise up, then, to the fighting and rouse the rest of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.140">Here am I, to give you all those gifts, as many</p>
	<p id="IL.19.141">as brilliant Odysseus yesterday went to your shelter and promised.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.142">Or if you will, hold back, though you lean hard into the battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.143">while my followers take the gifts from my ship and bring them</p>
	<p id="IL.19.144">to you, so you may see what I give to comfort your spirit.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.145">Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.146">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.147">the gifts are yours to give if you wish, and as it is proper,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.148">or to keep with yourself. But now let us remember our joy in warcraft,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.149">immediately, for it is not fitting to stay here and waste time</p>
	<p id="IL.19.150">nor delay, since there is still a big work to be done.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.151">So can a man see once more Achilleus among the front fighters</p>
	<p id="IL.19.152">with the bronze spear wrecking the Trojan battalions. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.19.153">let each of you remember this and fight his antagonist.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.154">Then in answer to him spoke resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.155">'Not that way, good fighter that you are, godlike Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.156">Do not drive the sons of the Achaians on Ilion when they are hungry,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.157">to fight against the Trojans, since not short will be the time</p>
	<p id="IL.19.158">of battle, once the massed formations of men have encountered</p>
	<p id="IL.19.159">together, with the god inspiring fury in both sides.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.160">Rather tell the men of Achaia here by their swift ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.161">to take food and wine, since these make fighting fury and warcraft.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.162">For a man will not have strength to fight his way forward all day</p>
	<p id="IL.19.163">long until the sun goes down if he is starved for food. Even</p>
	<p id="IL.19.164">though in his heart he be very passionate for the battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.165">yet without his knowing it his limbs will go heavy, and hunger</p>
	<p id="IL.19.166">and thirst will catch up with him and cumber his knees as he moves on.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.167">But when a man has been well filled with wine and with eating</p>
	<p id="IL.19.168">and then does battle all day long against the enemy,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.169">why, then the heart inside him is full of cheer, nor do his limbs</p>
	<p id="IL.19.170">get weary, until all are ready to give over the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.171">Come then, tell your men to scatter and bid them get ready</p>
	<p id="IL.19.172">a meal; and as for the gifts, let the lord of men Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.19.173">bring them to the middle of our assembly so all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.19.174">can see them before their eyes, so your own heart may be pleasured.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.175">And let him stand up before the Argives and swear an oath to you</p>
	<p id="IL.19.176">that he never entered into her bed and never lay with her</p>
	<p id="IL.19.177">as is natural for people, my lord, between men and women.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.178">And by this let the spirit in your own heart be made gracious.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.179">After that in his own shelter let him appease you</p>
	<p id="IL.19.180">with a generous meal, so you will lack nothing of what is due you.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.181">And you, son of Atreus, after this be more righteous to another</p>
	<p id="IL.19.182">man. For there is no fault when even one who is a king</p>
	<p id="IL.19.183">appeases a man, when the king was the first one to be angry.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.184">Then in turn the lord of men Agamemnon answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.185">'Hearing what you have said, son of Laertes, I am pleased with you.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.186">Fairly have you gone through everything and explained it.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.187">And all this I am willing to swear to, and my heart urges me,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.188">and I will not be foresworn before the gods. Let Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.189">stay here the while, though he lean very hard toward the work of the war god,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.190">and remain the rest of you all here assembled, until the gifts come</p>
	<p id="IL.19.191">back from my shelter and while we cut our oaths of fidelity.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.192">And for you yourself, Odysseus, I give you this errand, this order,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.193">that you choose out excellent young men of all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.19.194">and bring the gifts back here from my ship, all that you promised</p>
	<p id="IL.19.195">yesterday to Achilleus, and bring the women back also.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.196">And in the wide host of the Achaians let Talthybios make ready</p>
	<p id="IL.19.197">a boar for me, and dedicate it to Zeus and Helios.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.198">Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.199">'Son of Atreus, most lordly and king of men, Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.200">at some other time rather you should busy yourself about these things,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.201">when there is some stopping point in the fighting, at some time</p>
	<p id="IL.19.202">when there is not so much fury inside of my heart. But now</p>
	<p id="IL.19.203">as things are they lie there torn whom the son of Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.19.204">Hektor has beaten down, since Zeus was giving him glory,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.205">and then you urge a man to eating. No, but I would now</p>
	<p id="IL.19.206">drive forward the sons of the Achaians into the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.19.207">starving and unfed, and afterwards when the sun sets</p>
	<p id="IL.19.208">make ready a great dinner, when we have paid off our defilement.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.209">But before this, for me at least, neither drink nor food shall</p>
	<p id="IL.19.210">go down my very throat, since my companion has perished</p>
	<p id="IL.19.211">and lies inside my shelter torn about with the cutting</p>
	<p id="IL.19.212">bronze, and turned against the forecourt while my companions</p>
	<p id="IL.19.213">mourn about him. Food and drink mean nothing to my heart</p>
	<p id="IL.19.214">but blood does, and slaughter, and the groaning of men in the hard work.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.215">Then in answer to him spoke resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.216">'Son of Peleus, Achilleus, far greatest of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.217">you are stronger than I am and greater by not a little</p>
	<p id="IL.19.218">with the spear, yet I in turn might overpass you in wisdom</p>
	<p id="IL.19.219">by far, since I was born before you and have learned more things.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.220">Therefore let your heart endure to listen to my words.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.221">When there is battle men have suddenly their fill of it</p>
	<p id="IL.19.222">when the bronze scatters on the ground the straw in most numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.19.223">and the harvest is most thin, when Zeus has poised his balance,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.224">Zeus, who is administrator to men in their fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.225">There is no way the Achaians can mourn a dead man by denying</p>
	<p id="IL.19.226">the belly. Too many fall day by day, one upon another,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.227">and how could anyone find breathing space from his labour?</p>
	<p id="IL.19.228">No, but we must harden our hearts and bury the man who</p>
	<p id="IL.19.229">dies, when we have wept over him on the day, and all those</p>
	<p id="IL.19.230">who are left about from the hateful work of war must remember</p>
	<p id="IL.19.231">food and drink, so that afterwards all the more strongly</p>
	<p id="IL.19.232">we may fight on forever relentless against our enemies</p>
	<p id="IL.19.233">with the weariless bronze put on about our bodies. Let one not</p>
	<p id="IL.19.234">wait longing for any other summons to stir on the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.235">This summons now shall be an evil on anyone left behind</p>
	<p id="IL.19.236">by the ships of the Argives. Therefore let us drive on together</p>
	<p id="IL.19.237">and wake the bitter war god on the Trojans, breakers of horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.238">He spoke, and went away with the sons of glorious Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.239">with Meges, the son of Phyleus, and Meriones, and Thoas,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.240">and Lykomedes, the son of Kreion, and Melanippos. These went</p>
	<p id="IL.19.241">on their way to the shelter of Atreus' son Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.242">No sooner was the order given than the thing had been done.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.243">They brought back seven tripods from the shelter, those Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.19.244">had promised, and twenty shining cauldrons, twelve horses. They brought back</p>
	<p id="IL.19.245">immediately the seven women the work of whose hands was</p>
	<p id="IL.19.246">blameless, and the eighth of them was Briseis of the fair cheeks.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.247">Odysseus weighed out ten full talents of gold and led them</p>
	<p id="IL.19.248">back, and the young men of the Achaians carried the other gifts.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.249">They brought these into the midst of assembly, and Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.19.250">stood up, and Talthybios in voice like an immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.19.251">stood beside the shepherd of the people with the boar in his hands.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.252">Atreus' son laid hands upon his work-knife, and drew it</p>
	<p id="IL.19.253">from where it hung ever beside the great sheath of his war sword,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.254">and cut first hairs away from the boar, and lifting his hands up</p>
	<p id="IL.19.255">to Zeus, prayed, while all the Argives stayed fast at their places</p>
	<p id="IL.19.256">in silence and in order of station, and listened to their king.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.257">He spoke before them in prayer gazing into the wide sky:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.258">'Let Zeus first be my witness, highest of the gods and greatest,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.259">and Earth, and Helios the Sun, and Furies, who underground</p>
	<p id="IL.19.260">avenge dead men, when any man has sworn to a falsehood,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.261">that I have never laid a hand on the girl Briseis</p>
	<p id="IL.19.262">on pretext to go to bed with her, or for any other</p>
	<p id="IL.19.263">reason, but she remained, not singled out, in my shelter.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.264">If any of this is falsely sworn, may the gods give me many</p>
	<p id="IL.19.265">griefs, all that they inflict on those who swear falsely before them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.266">So he spoke, and with pitiless bronze he cut the boar's throat.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.267">Talthybios whirled the body about, and threw it in the great reach</p>
	<p id="IL.19.268">of the grey sea, to feed the fishes. Meanwhile Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.269">stood up among the battle-fond Achaians, and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.270">'Father Zeus, great are the delusions with which you visit men.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.271">Without you, the son of Atreus could never have stirred so</p>
	<p id="IL.19.272">the heart inside my breast, nor taken the girl away from me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.273">against my will, and be in helplessness. No, but Zeus somehow</p>
	<p id="IL.19.274">wished that death should befall great numbers of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.275">Go now and take your dinner, so we may draw on the battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.276">So he spoke, and suddenly broke up the assembly.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.277">Now these scattered away each man to his own ship. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.19.278">the great-hearted Myrmidons disposed of the presents.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.279">They went on their way carrying them to the ship of godlike Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.280">and stowed the gifts in the shelters, and let the women be settled,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.281">while proud henchmen drove the horses into Achilleus' horse-herd.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.282">And now, in the likeness of golden Aphrodite, Briseis</p>
	<p id="IL.19.283">when she saw Patroklos lying torn with sharp bronze, folding</p>
	<p id="IL.19.284">him in her arms cried shrilly above him and with her hands tore</p>
	<p id="IL.19.285">at her breasts and her soft throat and her beautiful forehead.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.286">The woman like the immortals mourning for him spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.287">'Patroklos, far most pleasing to my heart in its sorrows,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.288">I left you here alive when I went away from the shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.289">but now I come back, lord of the people, to find you have fallen.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.290">So evil in my life takes over from evil forever.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.291">The husband on whom my father and honoured mother bestowed me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.292">I saw before my city lying torn with the sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.293">and my three brothers, whom a single mother bore with me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.294">and who were close to me, all went on one day to destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.295">And yet you would not let me, when swift Achilleus had cut down</p>
	<p id="IL.19.296">my husband, and sacked the city of godlike Mynes, you would not</p>
	<p id="IL.19.297">let me sorrow, but said you would make me godlike Achilleus'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.298">wedded lawful wife, that you would take me back in the ships</p>
	<p id="IL.19.299">to Phthia, and formalize my marriage among the Myrmidons.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.300">Therefore I weep your death without ceasing. You were kind always.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.301">So she spoke, lamenting, and the women sorrowed around her</p>
	<p id="IL.19.302">grieving openly for Patroklos, but for her own sorrows</p>
	<p id="IL.19.303">each. But the lords of Achaia were gathered about Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.304">beseeching him to eat, but he with a groan denied them:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.305">'I beg of you, if any dear companion will listen</p>
	<p id="IL.19.306">to me, stop urging me to satisfy the heart in me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.307">with food and drink, since this strong sorrow has come upon me.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.308">I will hold out till the sun goes down and endure, though it be hard.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.309">So he spoke, and caused the rest of the kings to scatter;</p>
	<p id="IL.19.310">but the two sons of Atreus stayed with him, and brilliant Odysseus,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.311">and Nestor, and Idomeneus, and the aged charioteer, Phoinix,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.312">comforting him close in his sorrow, yet his heart would not</p>
	<p id="IL.19.313">be comforted, till he went into the jaws of the bleeding battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.314">Remembering Patroklos he sighed much for him, and spoke aloud:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.315">'There was a time, ill fated, o dearest of all my companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.316">when you yourself would set the desirable dinner before me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.317">quickly and expertly, at the time the Achaians were urgent</p>
	<p id="IL.19.318">to carry sorrowful war on the Trojans, breakers of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.319">But now you lie here torn before me, and my heart goes starved</p>
	<p id="IL.19.320">for meat and drink, though they are here beside me, by reason</p>
	<p id="IL.19.321">of longing for you. There is nothing worse than this I could suffer,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.322">not even if I were to hear of the death of my father</p>
	<p id="IL.19.323">who now, I think, in Phthia somewhere lets fall a soft tear</p>
	<p id="IL.19.324">for bereavement of such a son, for me, who now in a strange land</p>
	<p id="IL.19.325">make war upon the Trojans for the sake of accursed Helen;</p>
	<p id="IL.19.326">or the death of my dear son, who is raised for my sake in Skyros</p>
	<p id="IL.19.327">now, if godlike Neoptolemos is still one of the living.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.328">Before now the spirit inside my breast was hopeful</p>
	<p id="IL.19.329">that I alone should die far away from horse-pasturing Argos</p>
	<p id="IL.19.330">here in Troy; I hoped you would win back again to Phthia</p>
	<p id="IL.19.331">so that in a fast black ship you could take my son back</p>
	<p id="IL.19.332">from Skyros to Phthia, and show him all my possessions,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.333">my property, my serving men, my great high-roofed house.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.334">For by this time I think that Peleus must altogether</p>
	<p id="IL.19.335">have perished, or still keeps a little scant life in sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.19.336">for the hatefulness of old age and because he waits ever from me</p>
	<p id="IL.19.337">the evil message, for the day he hears I have been killed.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.338">So he spoke, mourning, and the elders lamented around him</p>
	<p id="IL.19.339">remembering each those he had left behind in his own halls.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.340">The son of Kronos took pity on them as he watched them mourning</p>
	<p id="IL.19.341">and immediately spoke in winged words to Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.342">'My child, have you utterly abandoned the man of your choice?</p>
	<p id="IL.19.343">Is there no longer deep concern in your heart for Achilleus?</p>
	<p id="IL.19.344">Now he has sat down before the steep horned ships and is mourning</p>
	<p id="IL.19.345">for his own beloved companion, while all the others</p>
	<p id="IL.19.346">have gone to take their dinner, but he is fasting and unfed.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.347">Go then to him and distil nectar inside his chest, and delicate</p>
	<p id="IL.19.348">ambrosia, so the weakness of hunger will not come upon him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.349">Speaking so, he stirred Athene, who was eager before this,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.350">and she in the likeness of a wide-winged, thin-crying</p>
	<p id="IL.19.351">hawk plummeted from the sky through the bright air. Now the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.19.352">were arming at once along the encampment. She dropped the delicate</p>
	<p id="IL.19.353">ambrosia and the nectar inside the breast of Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.354">softly, so no sad weakness of hunger would come on his knees,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.355">and she herself went back to the close house of her powerful</p>
	<p id="IL.19.356">father, while they were scattering out away from the fast ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.357">As when in their thickness the snowflakes of Zeus come fluttering</p>
	<p id="IL.19.358">cold beneath the blast of the north wind born in the bright sky,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.359">so now in their thickness the pride of the helms bright shining</p>
	<p id="IL.19.360">were carried out from the ships, and shields massive in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.19.361">and the corselets strongly hollowed and the ash spears were worn forth.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.362">The shining swept to the sky and all earth was laughing about them</p>
	<p id="IL.19.363">under the glitter of bronze and beneath their feet stirred the thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.19.364">of men, within whose midst brilliant Achilleus helmed him.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.365">A clash went from the grinding of his teeth, and his eyes glowed</p>
	<p id="IL.19.366">as if they were the stare of a fire, and the heart inside him</p>
	<p id="IL.19.367">was entered with sorrow beyond endurance. Raging at the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.19.368">he put on the gifts of the god, that Hephaistos wrought him with much toil.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.369">First he placed along his legs the fair greaves linked with</p>
	<p id="IL.19.370">silver fastenings to hold the greaves at the ankles.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.371">Afterward he girt on about his chest the corselet,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.372">and across his shoulders slung the sword with the nails of silver,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.373">a bronze sword, and caught up the great shield, huge and heavy</p>
	<p id="IL.19.374">next, and from it the light glimmered far, as from the moon.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.375">And as when from across water a light shines to mariners</p>
	<p id="IL.19.376">from a blazing fire, when the fire is burning high in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.19.377">in a desolate steading, as the mariners are carried unwilling</p>
	<p id="IL.19.378">by storm winds over the fish-swarming sea, far away from their loved ones;</p>
	<p id="IL.19.379">so the light from the fair elaborate shield of Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.19.380">shot into the high air. And lifting the helm he set it</p>
	<p id="IL.19.381">massive upon his head, and the helmet crested with horse-hair</p>
	<p id="IL.19.382">shone like a star, the golden fringes were shaken about it</p>
	<p id="IL.19.383">which Hephaistos had driven close along the horn of the helmet.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.384">And brilliant Achilleus tried himself in his armour, to see</p>
	<p id="IL.19.385">if it fitted close, and how his glorious limbs ran within it,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.386">and the armour became as wings and upheld the shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.387">Next he pulled out from its standing place the spear of his father,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.388">huge, heavy, thick, which no one else of all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.19.389">could handle, but Achilleus alone knew how to wield it,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.390">the Pelian ash spear which Cheiron had brought to his father</p>
	<p id="IL.19.391">from high on Pelion, to be death for fighters in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.392">Automedon and Alkimos, in charge of the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.393">yoked them, and put the fair breast straps about them, and forced the bits home</p>
	<p id="IL.19.394">between their jaws, and pulled the reins back against the compacted</p>
	<p id="IL.19.395">chariot seat, and one, Automedon, took up the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.19.396">whip caught close in his hand and vaulted up to the chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.397">while behind him Achilleus helmed for battle took his stance</p>
	<p id="IL.19.398">shining in all his armour like the sun when he crosses above us,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.399">and cried in a terrible voice on the horses of his father:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.400">'Xanthos, Balios, Bay and Dapple, famed sons of Podarge,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.401">take care to bring in another way your charioteer back</p>
	<p id="IL.19.402">to the company of the Danaans, when we give over fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.403">not leave him to lie fallen there, as you did to Patroklos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.404">Then from beneath the yoke the gleam-footed horse answered him,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.405">Xanthos, and as he spoke bowed his head, so that all the mane</p>
	<p id="IL.19.406">fell away from the pad and swept the ground by the cross-yoke;</p>
	<p id="IL.19.407">the goddess of the white arms, Hera, had put a voice in him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.408">'We shall still keep you safe for this time, o hard Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.409">And yet the day of your death is near, but it is not we</p>
	<p id="IL.19.410">who are to blame, but a great god and powerful Destiny.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.411">For it was not because we were slow, because we were careless,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.412">that the Trojans have taken the armour from the shoulders of Patroklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.413">but it was that high god, the child of lovely-haired Leto,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.414">who killed him among the champions and gave the glory to Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.415">But for us, we two could run with the blast of the west wind</p>
	<p id="IL.19.416">who they say is the lightest of all things; yet still for you</p>
	<p id="IL.19.417">there is destiny to be killed in force by a god and a mortal.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.418">When he had spoken so the Furies stopped the voice in him,</p>
	<p id="IL.19.419">but deeply disturbed, Achilleus of the swift feet answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.19.420">'Xanthos, why do you prophesy my death? This is not for you.</p>
	<p id="IL.19.421">I myself know well it is destined for me to die here</p>
	<p id="IL.19.422">far from my beloved father and mother. But for all that</p>
	<p id="IL.19.423">I will not stop till the Trojans have had enough of my fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.19.424">He spoke, and shouting held on in the foremost his single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.1">So these now, the Achaians, beside the curved ships were arming</p>
	<p id="IL.20.2">around you, son of Peleus, insatiate of battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.3">while on the other side at the break of the plain the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.20.4">armed. But Zeus, from the many-folded peak of Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.5">told Themis to summon all the gods into assembly. She went</p>
	<p id="IL.20.6">everywhere, and told them to make their way to Zeus' house.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.7">There was no river who was not there, except only Ocean,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.8">there was not any one of the nymphs who live in the lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.20.9">groves, and the springs of rivers and grass of the meadows, who came not.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.10">These all assembling into the house of Zeus cloud gathering</p>
	<p id="IL.20.11">took places among the smooth-stone cloister walks which Hephaistos</p>
	<p id="IL.20.12">had built for Zeus the father by his craftsmanship and contrivance.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.13">So they were assembled within Zeus' house; and the shaker</p>
	<p id="IL.20.14">of the earth did not fail to hear the goddess, but came up among them</p>
	<p id="IL.20.15">from the sea, and sat in the midst of them, and asked Zeus of his counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.16">'Why, lord of the shining bolt, have you called the gods to assembly</p>
	<p id="IL.20.17">once more? Are you deliberating Achaians and Trojans?</p>
	<p id="IL.20.18">For the onset of battle is almost broken to flame between them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.19">In turn Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to him in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.20">'You have seen, shaker of the earth, the counsel within me,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.21">and why I gathered you. I think of these men though they are dying.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.22">Even so, I shall stay here upon the fold of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.20.23">sitting still, watching, to pleasure my heart. Meanwhile all you others</p>
	<p id="IL.20.24">go down, wherever you may go among the Achaians and Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.20.25">and give help to either side, as your own pleasure directs you.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.26">For if we leave Achilleus alone to fight with the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.20.27">they will not even for a little hold off swift-footed Peleion.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.28">For even before now they would tremble whenever they saw him,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.29">and now, when his heart is grieved and angered for his companion's</p>
	<p id="IL.20.30">death, I fear against destiny he may storm their fortress.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.31">So spoke the son of Kronos and woke the incessant battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.32">and the gods went down to enter the fighting, with purposes opposed.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.33">Hera went to the assembled ships with Pallas Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.20.34">and with Poseidon who embraces the earth, and with generous</p>
	<p id="IL.20.35">Hermes, who within the heart is armed with astute thoughts.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.36">Hephaistos went the way of these in the pride of his great strength</p>
	<p id="IL.20.37">limping, and yet his shrunken legs moved lightly beneath him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.38">But Ares of the shining helm went over to the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.39">and with him Phoibos of the unshorn hair, and the lady of arrows</p>
	<p id="IL.20.40">Artemis, and smiling Aphrodite, Leto, and Xanthos.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.41">Now in the time when the gods were still distant from the mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.42">so long the Achaians were winning great glory, since now Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.43">showed among them, who had stayed too long from the sorrowful fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.44">But the Trojans were taken every man in the knees with trembling</p>
	<p id="IL.20.45">and terror, as they looked on the swift-footed son of Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.46">shining in all his armour, a man like the murderous war god.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.47">But after the Olympians merged in the men's company</p>
	<p id="IL.20.48">strong Hatred, defender of peoples, burst out, and Athene bellowed</p>
	<p id="IL.20.49">standing now beside the ditch dug at the wall's outside</p>
	<p id="IL.20.50">and now again at the thundering sea's edge gave out her great cry,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.51">while on the other side Ares in the likeness of a dark stormcloud</p>
	<p id="IL.20.52">bellowed, now from the peak of the citadel urging the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.20.53">sharply on, now running beside the sweet banks of Simoeis.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.54">So the blessed gods stirring on the opponents drove them</p>
	<p id="IL.20.55">together, and broke out among themselves the weight of their quarrel.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.56">From high above the father of gods and men made thunder</p>
	<p id="IL.20.57">terribly, while Poseidon from deep under them shuddered</p>
	<p id="IL.20.58">all the illimitable earth, the sheer heads of the mountains.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.59">And all the feet of Ida with her many waters were shaken</p>
	<p id="IL.20.60">and all her crests, and the city of Troy, the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.61">Aïdoneus, lord of the dead below, was in terror</p>
	<p id="IL.20.62">and sprang from his throne and screamed aloud, for fear that above him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.63">he who circles the land, Poseidon, might break the earth open</p>
	<p id="IL.20.64">and the houses of the dead lie open to men and immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.65">ghastly and mouldering, so the very gods shudder before them;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.66">such was the crash that sounded as the gods came driving together</p>
	<p id="IL.20.67">in wrath. For now over against the lord Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.20.68">Phoibos Apollo took his stand with his feathered arrows,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.69">and against Enyalios the goddess grey-eyed Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.70">Against Hera stood the lady of clamour, of the golden distaff,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.71">of the showering arrows, Artemis, sister of the far striker.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.72">Opposite Leto stood the strong one, generous Hermes,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.73">and against Hephaistos stood the great deep-eddying river</p>
	<p id="IL.20.74">who is called Xanthos by the gods, but by mortals Skamandros.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.75">Thus gods went on to encounter gods; and meanwhile Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.76">was straining to plunge into the combat opposite Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.20.77">Priam's son, since beyond all others his anger was driving him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.78">to glut with his blood Ares the god who fights under the shield's guard.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.79">But it was Aineias whom Apollo defender of people</p>
	<p id="IL.20.80">drove straight against Peleion, and inspired vast power within him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.81">Zeus' son Apollo made his voice like that of Lykaon</p>
	<p id="IL.20.82">Priam's son, and assumed his appearance, and spoke to Aineias:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.83">'Aineias, lord of the Trojans' counsels. Where are those threats gone</p>
	<p id="IL.20.84">which as you drank your wine you made before Troy's kings, solemnly,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.85">that you would match your battle strength with Peleian Achilleus?'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.86">In turn Aineias spoke to him in answer: 'Lykaon</p>
	<p id="IL.20.87">son of Priam, why do you urge me on against my will</p>
	<p id="IL.20.88">to fight in the face of Peleus' son and his too great fury?</p>
	<p id="IL.20.89">Since this will not be the first time I stand up against swift-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.20.90">Achilleus, but another time before now he drove me</p>
	<p id="IL.20.91">with the spear from Ida, when he came there after our cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.20.92">the time he sacked Lyrnessos and Pedasos. But Zeus rescued me</p>
	<p id="IL.20.93">when he put strength inside me and made my knees quick. Otherwise</p>
	<p id="IL.20.94">I should have gone down at Achilleus' hands, and those of Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.20.95">who goes before him and makes light before him, who then was urging</p>
	<p id="IL.20.96">him on with the brazen spear to destroy Leleges and Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.97">Thereby it is not for any man to fight with Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.98">There is always some one of the gods with him to beat death from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.99">Without this, even, his spear wings straight to its mark, nor gives out</p>
	<p id="IL.20.100">until it has gone through a man's body. But if the god only</p>
	<p id="IL.20.101">would pull out even the issue of war, he would not so easily</p>
	<p id="IL.20.102">win, not even though he claims to be made all of bronze.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.103">In turn the lord the son of Zeus Apollo spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.104">'Hero, then make your prayer, you also, to the everlasting</p>
	<p id="IL.20.105">gods, since they say that you yourself are born of Zeus' daughter</p>
	<p id="IL.20.106">Aphrodite, but Achilleus was born of a lesser goddess,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.107">Aphrodite being daughter of Zeus, Thetis of the sea's ancient.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.108">Carry your weariless bronze straight against him, let him by no means</p>
	<p id="IL.20.109">turn you back by blustering words and his threats of terror.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.110">So speaking, he inspired enormous strength in the shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.111">who strode on his way among the champions helmed in the bright bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.112">nor did Hera of the white arms fail to see the son of Anchises</p>
	<p id="IL.20.113">as he went through the thronging men to face the son of Peleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.114">and drew the other immortals about her and spoke to them, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.115">'Poseidon and Athene, now take counsel between you</p>
	<p id="IL.20.116">and within your hearts as to how these matters shall be accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.117">Here is Aineias gone helmed in the shining bronze against</p>
	<p id="IL.20.118">Peleus' son, and it was Phoibos Apollo who sent him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.119">Come then, we must even go down ourselves and turn him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.120">back from here, or else one of us must stand by Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.121">and put enormous strength upon him, and let him not come short</p>
	<p id="IL.20.122">in courage, but let him know that they love him who are the highest</p>
	<p id="IL.20.123">of the immortals, but those who before now fended the fury</p>
	<p id="IL.20.124">of war, as now, from the Trojans are as wind and nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.125">For all of us have come down from Olympos to take our part</p>
	<p id="IL.20.126">in this battle, so nothing may be done to him by the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.20.127">on this day. Afterwards he shall suffer such things as Destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.20.128">wove with the strand of his birth that day he was born to his mother.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.129">But if Achilleus does not hear all this from gods' voices</p>
	<p id="IL.20.130">he will be afraid, when a god puts out his strength against him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.131">in the fighting. It is hard for gods to be shown in their true shape.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.132">In turn Poseidon the shaker of the earth answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.133">'Hera, do not be angry without purpose. It does not</p>
	<p id="IL.20.134">become you, since I at least would not have the rest of us gods</p>
	<p id="IL.20.135">encounter in battle, since indeed we are far too strong for them.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.136">Let us then go away and sit down together off the path</p>
	<p id="IL.20.137">at a viewing place, and let the men take care of their fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.138">Only if Ares begins to fight, or Phoibos Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.139">or if they hold Achilleus back and will not let him fight,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.140">then at once they will have a quarrel with us on their hands</p>
	<p id="IL.20.141">in open battle. But soon, I think, when they have fought with us</p>
	<p id="IL.20.142">they will get back to Olympos and the throng of the other gods</p>
	<p id="IL.20.143">beaten back by the overmastering strength of our hands.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.144">So he spoke, Poseidon of the dark hair, and led the way</p>
	<p id="IL.20.145">to the stronghold of godlike Herakles, earth-piled on both sides,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.146">a high place, which the Trojans and Pallas Athene had built him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.147">as a place of escape where he could get away from the Sea Beast</p>
	<p id="IL.20.148">when the charging monster drove him away to the plain from the seashore.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.149">There Poseidon and the gods who were with him sat down</p>
	<p id="IL.20.150">and gathered a breakless wall of cloud to darken their shoulders;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.151">while they of the other side sat down on the brows of the sweet bluffs</p>
	<p id="IL.20.152">around you, lord Apollo, and Ares sacker of cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.153">So they on either side took their places, deliberating</p>
	<p id="IL.20.154">counsels, reluctant on both sides to open the sorrowful</p>
	<p id="IL.20.155">attack. But Zeus sitting on high above urged them on.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.156">But all the plain was filled and shining with bronze of the mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.157">their men and horses, and underneath their feet the earth staggered</p>
	<p id="IL.20.158">as they swept together. Two men far greater than all the others</p>
	<p id="IL.20.159">were coming to encounter, furious to fight with each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.160">Aineias, the son of Anchises, and brilliant Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.161">First of the two Aineias had strode forth in menace, tossing</p>
	<p id="IL.20.162">his head beneath the heavy helm, and he held the stark shield</p>
	<p id="IL.20.163">in front of his chest, and shook the brazen spear. From the other</p>
	<p id="IL.20.164">side the son of Peleus rose like a lion against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.165">the baleful beast, when men have been straining to kill him, the county</p>
	<p id="IL.20.166">all in the hunt, and he at the first pays them no attention</p>
	<p id="IL.20.167">but goes his way, only when some one of the impetuous young men</p>
	<p id="IL.20.168">has hit him with the spear he whirls, jaws open, over his teeth foam</p>
	<p id="IL.20.169">breaks out, and in the depth of his chest the powerful heart groans;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.170">he lashes his own ribs with his tail and the flanks on both sides</p>
	<p id="IL.20.171">as he rouses himself to fury for the fight, eyes glaring,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.172">and hurls himself straight onward on the chance of killing some one</p>
	<p id="IL.20.173">of the men, or else being killed himself in the first onrush.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.174">So the proud heart and fighting fury stirred on Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.175">to go forward in the face of great-hearted Aineias.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.176">Now as these in their advance had come close to each other</p>
	<p id="IL.20.177">first of the two to speak was swift-footed brilliant Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.178">'Aineias, why have you stood so far forth from the multitude</p>
	<p id="IL.20.179">against me? Does the desire in your heart drive you to combat</p>
	<p id="IL.20.180">in hope you will be lord of the Trojans, breakers of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.181">and of Priam's honour. And yet even if you were to kill me</p>
	<p id="IL.20.182">Priam would not because of that rest such honour on your hand.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.183">He has sons, and he himself is sound, not weakened.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.184">Or have the men of Troy promised you a piece of land, surpassing</p>
	<p id="IL.20.185">all others, fine ploughland and orchard for you to administer</p>
	<p id="IL.20.186">if you kill me? But I think that killing will not be easy.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.187">Another time before this, I tell you, you ran from my spear.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.188">Or do you not remember when, apart from your cattle, I caught you</p>
	<p id="IL.20.189">alone, and chased you in the speed of your feet down the hills of Ida</p>
	<p id="IL.20.190">headlong, and that time as you ran you did not turn to look back.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.191">Then you got away into Lyrnessos, but I went after you</p>
	<p id="IL.20.192">and stormed that place, with the help of Athene and of Zeus father,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.193">and took the day of liberty away from their women</p>
	<p id="IL.20.194">and led them as spoil, but Zeus and the other gods saved you.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.195">I think they will not save you now, as your expectation</p>
	<p id="IL.20.196">tells you they will. No, but I myself urge you to get back</p>
	<p id="IL.20.197">into the multitude, not stand to face me, before you</p>
	<p id="IL.20.198">take some harm. Once a thing has been done, the fool sees it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.199">Then in turn Aineias spoke to him and made his answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.200">'Son of Peleus, never hope by words to frighten me</p>
	<p id="IL.20.201">as if I were a baby. I myself understand well enough</p>
	<p id="IL.20.202">how to speak in vituperation and how to make insults.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.203">You and I know each other's birth, we both know our parents</p>
	<p id="IL.20.204">since we have heard the lines of their fame from mortal men; only</p>
	<p id="IL.20.205">I have never with my eyes seen your parents, nor have you seen mine.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.206">For you, they say you are the issue of blameless Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.207">and that your mother was Thetis of the lovely hair, the sea's lady;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.208">I in turn claim I am the son of great-hearted Anchises</p>
	<p id="IL.20.209">but that my mother was Aphrodite; and that of these parents</p>
	<p id="IL.20.210">one group or the other will have a dear son to mourn for</p>
	<p id="IL.20.211">this day. Since I believe we will not in mere words, like children,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.212">meet, and separate and go home again out of the fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.213">Even so, if you wish to learn all this and be certain</p>
	<p id="IL.20.214">of my genealogy: there are plenty of men who know it.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.215">First of all Zeus who gathers the clouds had a son, Dardanos</p>
	<p id="IL.20.216">who founded Dardania, since there was yet no sacred Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.20.217">made a city in the plain to be a centre of peoples,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.218">but they lived yet in the underhills of Ida with all her waters.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.219">Dardanos in turn had a son, the king, Erichthonios,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.220">who became the richest of mortal men, and in his possession</p>
	<p id="IL.20.221">were three thousand horses who pastured along the low grasslands,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.222">mares in their pride with their young colts; and with these the North Wind</p>
	<p id="IL.20.223">fell in love as they pastured there, and took on upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.224">the likeness of a dark-maned stallion, and coupled with them,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.225">and the mares conceiving of him bore to him twelve young horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.226">Those, when they would play along the grain-giving tilled land</p>
	<p id="IL.20.227">would pass along the tassels of corn and not break the divine yield,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.228">but again, when they played across the sea's wide ridges</p>
	<p id="IL.20.229">they would run the edge of the wave where it breaks on the grey salt water.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.230">Erichthonios had a son, Tros, who was lord of the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.231">and to Tros in turn there were born three sons unfaulted,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.232">Ilos and Assarakos and godlike Ganymedes</p>
	<p id="IL.20.233">who was the loveliest born of the race of mortals, and therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.20.234">the gods caught him away to themselves, to be Zeus' wine-pourer,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.235">for the sake of his beauty, so he might be among the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.236">Ilos in turn was given a son, the blameless Laomedon,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.237">and Laomedon had sons in turn, Tithonos and Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.238">Lampos, Klytios and Hiketaon, scion of Ares;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.239">but Assarakos had Kapys, and Kapys' son was Anchises,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.240">and I am Anchises' son, and Priam's is Hektor the brilliant.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.241">Such is the generation and blood I claim to be born from.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.242">Zeus builds up and Zeus diminishes the strength in men,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.243">the way he pleases, since his power is beyond all others'.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.244">But come, let us no longer stand here talking of these things</p>
	<p id="IL.20.245">like children, here in the space between the advancing armies.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.246">For there are harsh things enough that could be spoken against us</p>
	<p id="IL.20.247">both, a ship of a hundred locks could not carry the burden.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.248">The tongue of man is a twisty thing, there are plenty of words there</p>
	<p id="IL.20.249">of every kind, the range of words is wide, and their variance.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.250">The sort of thing you say is the thing that will be said to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.251">But what have you and I to do with the need for squabbling</p>
	<p id="IL.20.252">and hurling insults at each other, as if we were two wives</p>
	<p id="IL.20.253">who when they have fallen upon a heart-perishing quarrel</p>
	<p id="IL.20.254">go out in the street and say abusive things to each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.255">much true, and much that is not, and it is their rage that drives them.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.256">You will not by talking turn me back from the strain of my warcraft,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.257">not till you have fought to my face with the bronze. Come on then</p>
	<p id="IL.20.258">and let us try each other's strength with the bronze of our spearheads.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.259">He spoke, and on the terrible grim shield drove the ponderous</p>
	<p id="IL.20.260">pike, so that the great shield moaned as it took the spearhead.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.261">The son of Peleus with his heavy hand held the shield away</p>
	<p id="IL.20.262">from him, in fright, since he thought the far-shadowing spear</p>
	<p id="IL.20.263">of great-hearted Aineias would lightly be driven through it.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.264">Fool, and the heart and spirit in him could not understand</p>
	<p id="IL.20.265">how the glorious gifts of the gods are not easily broken</p>
	<p id="IL.20.266">by mortal men, how such gifts will not give way before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.267">Nor this time could the ponderous spear of war-wise Aineias</p>
	<p id="IL.20.268">smash the shield, since the gold stayed it, the god's gift. Indeed</p>
	<p id="IL.20.269">he did drive the spear through two folds, but there were three left</p>
	<p id="IL.20.270">still, since the god of the dragging feet had made five folds on it,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.271">two of bronze on the outside and on the inside two of tin</p>
	<p id="IL.20.272">and between them the single gold, and in this the ash spear was held fast.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.273">After him Achilleus let go his spear far shadowing</p>
	<p id="IL.20.274">and struck the shield of Aineias along its perfect circle</p>
	<p id="IL.20.275">at the utter rim where the circle of bronze ran thinnest about it</p>
	<p id="IL.20.276">and the oxhide was laid thinnest there. The Pelian ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.20.277">crashed clean through it there, and the shield cried out as it went through.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.278">Aineias shrank down and held the shield away and above him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.279">in fright, and the spear went over his back and crashed its way</p>
	<p id="IL.20.280">to the ground, and fixed there, after tearing apart two circles</p>
	<p id="IL.20.281">of the man-covering shield. But Aineias, free of the long spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.282">stood still, and around his eyes gathered the enormous emotion</p>
	<p id="IL.20.283">and fear, that the weapon had fixed so close to him. Now Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.284">drew his tearing sword and swept in fury upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.285">crying a terrible cry, but Aineias now in his hand caught</p>
	<p id="IL.20.286">up a stone, a huge thing which no two men could carry</p>
	<p id="IL.20.287">such as men are now, but by himself he lightly hefted it.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.288">And there Aineias would have hit him with the stone as he swept in,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.289">on helm or shield, which would have fended the bitter death from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.290">and Peleus' son would have closed with the sword and stripped the life from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.291">had not the shaker of the earth Poseidon sharply perceived all</p>
	<p id="IL.20.292">and immediately spoken his word out among the immortals:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.293">'Ah me; I am full of sorrow for great-hearted Aineias</p>
	<p id="IL.20.294">who must presently go down to death, overpowered by Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.295">because he believed the words of Apollo, the far ranging;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.296">poor fool, since Apollo will do nothing to keep grim death from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.297">But why does this man, who is guiltless, suffer his sorrows</p>
	<p id="IL.20.298">for no reason, for the sake of others' unhappiness, and always</p>
	<p id="IL.20.299">he gives gifts that please them to the gods who hold the wide heaven.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.300">But come, let us ourselves get him away from death, for fear</p>
	<p id="IL.20.301">the son of Kronos may be angered if now Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.302">kills this man. It is destined that he shall be the survivor,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.303">that the generation of Dardanos shall not die, without seed</p>
	<p id="IL.20.304">obliterated, since Dardanos was dearest to Kronides</p>
	<p id="IL.20.305">of all his sons that have been born to him from mortal women.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.306">For Kronos' son has cursed the generation of Priam,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.307">and now the might of Aineias shall be lord over the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.308">and his sons' sons, and those who are born of their seed hereafter.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.309">In turn the lady of the ox eyes, Hera, answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.310">'Shaker of the earth, you yourself must decide in your own heart</p>
	<p id="IL.20.311">about Aineias, whether to rescue him or to let him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.312">go down, for all his strength, before Peleus' son, Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.313">For we two, Pallas Athene and I, have taken</p>
	<p id="IL.20.314">numerous oaths and sworn them in the sight of all the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.20.315">never to drive the day of evil away from the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.316">not even when all the city of Troy is burned in the ravening</p>
	<p id="IL.20.317">fire, on that day when the warlike sons of the Achaians burn it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.318">When he had heard this, the shaker of the earth Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.20.319">went on his way through the confusion of spears and the fighting,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.320">and came to where Aineias was, and renowned Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.321">There quickly he drifted a mist across the eyes of one fighter,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.322">Achilleus, Peleus' son, and from the shield of Aineias</p>
	<p id="IL.20.323">of the great heart pulled loose the strong bronze-headed ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.20.324">and laid it down again before the feet of Achilleus;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.325">but Aineias he lifted high from the ground, and slung him through the air</p>
	<p id="IL.20.326">so that many ranks of fighting men, many ranks of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.327">were overvaulted by Aineias, hurled by the god's hand.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.328">He landed at the uttermost edge of the tossing battle</p>
	<p id="IL.20.329">where the Kaukonians were arming them for the order of fighting.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.330">And Poseidon, shaker of the earth, came and stood very near him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.331">and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: 'Aineias,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.332">which one of the gods is it who urges you to such madness</p>
	<p id="IL.20.333">that you fight in the face of Peleus' son, against his high courage</p>
	<p id="IL.20.334">though he is both stronger than you and dearer to the immortals?</p>
	<p id="IL.20.335">Give back rather, whenever you find yourself thrown against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.336">lest beyond your fate you go down into the house of the death god.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.337">But once Achilleus has fulfilled his death and his destiny,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.338">then take courage, and go on, and fight with their foremost,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.339">since there shall be no other Achaian able to kill you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.340">He spoke, and left him there, when he had told him all this,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.341">and at once scattered the mist away from the eyes of Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.342">that the gods had sent, and now he looked with his eyes, and saw largely,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.343">and in disgust spoke then to his own great-hearted spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.344">'Can this be? Here is a strange thing I see with my own eyes.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.345">Here is my spear lying on the ground, but I can no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.20.346">see the man, whom I was charging in fury to kill him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.347">Aineias was then one beloved of the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.20.348">gods. I thought what he said was ineffectual boasting.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.349">Let him go. He will not again have daring to try me</p>
	<p id="IL.20.350">in battle, since even now he was glad to escape my onset.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.351">Come! I must urge on the Danaans whose delight is in battle</p>
	<p id="IL.20.352">and go on to face the rest of the Trojans, and see what they can do.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.353">He spoke, and leapt back into the ranks, and urged each man on:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.354">'No longer stand away from the Trojans, o great Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.355">but let each one go to face his man, furious to fight him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.356">It is a hard thing for me, for all my great strength, to harry</p>
	<p id="IL.20.357">the flight of men in such numbers or to fight with all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.358">Not Ares, who is a god immortal, not even Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.20.359">could take the edge of such masses of men and fight a way through them.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.360">But what I can do with hands and feet and strength I tell you</p>
	<p id="IL.20.361">I will do, and I shall not hang back even a little</p>
	<p id="IL.20.362">but go straight on through their formation, and I think that no man</p>
	<p id="IL.20.363">of the Trojans will be glad when he comes within my spear's range.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.364">He spoke, urging them on, but glorious Hektor called out</p>
	<p id="IL.20.365">in a great voice to the Trojans, and was minded to face Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.366">'Do not be afraid of Peleion, o high-hearted Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.367">I myself could fight in words against the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.368">but with the spear it were hard, since they are far stronger than we are.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.369">Even Achilleus will not win achievement of everything</p>
	<p id="IL.20.370">he says. Part he will accomplish, but part shall be baulked halfway done.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.371">I am going to stand against him now, though his hands are like flame,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.372">and his heart like the shining of iron.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.373">He spoke, urging the Trojans, and they lifted their spears to face them.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.374">Their fury gathered into bulk and their battle cry rose up.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.375">But now Phoibos Apollo stood by Hektor and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.376">'Hektor, do not go out all alone to fight with Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.377">but wait for him in the multitude and out of the carnage</p>
	<p id="IL.20.378">lest he hit you with the spear or the stroke of the sword from close in.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.379">He spoke, and Hektor plunged back into the swarm of the fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.20.380">men, in fear, when he heard the voice of the god speaking.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.381">But Achilleus, gathering the fury upon him, sprang on the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.20.382">with a ghastly cry, and the first of them he killed was Iphition</p>
	<p id="IL.20.383">the great son of Otrynteus and a lord over numbers of people,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.384">born of a naiad nymph to Otrynteus, sacker of cities,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.385">under the snows of Tmolos in the rich countryside of Hydë.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.386">Great Achilleus struck him with the spear as he came in fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.387">in the middle of the head, and all the head broke into two pieces.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.388">He fell, thunderously. Great Achilleus vaunted above him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.389">'Lie there, Otrynteus' son, most terrifying of all men.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.390">Here is your death, but your generation was by the lake waters</p>
	<p id="IL.20.391">of Gyge, where is the allotted land of your fathers</p>
	<p id="IL.20.392">by fish-swarming Hyllos and the whirling waters of Hermos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.393">He spoke, vaunting, but darkness shrouded the eyes of the other,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.394">and the running rims of Achaian chariots cut him to pieces</p>
	<p id="IL.20.395">in the van of the onrush. Next, after him, facing Demoleon</p>
	<p id="IL.20.396">lord defender of battle and son of Antenor, Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.397">stabbed him in the temple through the brazen sides of the helmet,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.398">and the brazen helmet could not hold, but the bronze spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.20.399">driven on through smashed the bone apart, and the inward</p>
	<p id="IL.20.400">brain was all spattered forth. So he beat him down in his fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.401">Next he stabbed with a spear-stroke in the back Hippodamas</p>
	<p id="IL.20.402">as he fled away before him and sprang from behind his horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.403">He blew his life away, bellowing, as when a bull</p>
	<p id="IL.20.404">bellows as he is dragged for Poseidon, lord of Helike,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.405">and the young men drag him. In such bulls the earth shaker glories.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.406">Such was his bellowing as the proud spirit flitted from his bones.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.407">Next he went with the spear after godlike Polydoros,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.408">Priam's son, whom his father would not let go into battle</p>
	<p id="IL.20.409">because he was youngest born of all his sons to him, and also</p>
	<p id="IL.20.410">the most beloved, and in speed of his feet outpassed all the others.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.411">But now, in his young thoughtlessness and display of his running</p>
	<p id="IL.20.412">he swept among the champions until thus he destroyed his dear life.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.413">For as he shot by swift-footed brilliant Achilleus hit him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.414">with a spear thrown in the middle of the back where the clasps of the war belt</p>
	<p id="IL.20.415">were golden and came together at the joining halves of the corselet.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.416">The spearhead held its way straight on and came out by the navel,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.417">and he dropped, moaning, on one knee as the dark mist gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.20.418">about him, and sagged, and caught with his hands at his bowels in front of him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.419">But now when Hektor saw Polydoros, his own brother,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.420">going limp to the ground and catching his bowels in his hands,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.421">the mist closed about his eyes also, he could stand no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.20.422">to turn there at a distance, but went out to face Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.423">hefting his sharp spear, like a flame. Seeing him Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.424">balanced his spear in turn, and called out to him, and challenged him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.425">'Here is the man who beyond all others has troubled my anger,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.426">who slaughtered my beloved companion. Let us no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.20.427">shrink away from each other along the edgeworks of battle.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.428">He spoke, and looking darkly at brilliant Hektor spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.429">'Come nearer, so that sooner you may reach your appointed destruction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.430">But with no fear Hektor of the shining helm answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.431">'Son of Peleus, never hope by words to frighten me</p>
	<p id="IL.20.432">as if I were a baby. I myself understand well enough</p>
	<p id="IL.20.433">how to speak in vituperation and how to make insults.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.434">I know that you are great and that I am far weaker than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.435">Still, all this lies upon the knees of the gods; and it may be</p>
	<p id="IL.20.436">that weaker as I am I might still strip the life from you</p>
	<p id="IL.20.437">with a cast of the spear, since my weapon too has been sharp before this.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.438">He spoke, and balanced the spear and let it fly. But Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.20.439">blew against it and turned it back from renowned Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.440">with an easy blast. It came back again to glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.20.441">and dropped to the ground in front of his feet. Meanwhile Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.442">made a furious charge against him, raging to kill him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.443">with a terrible cry, but Phoibos Apollo caught up Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.20.444">easily, since he was a god, and wrapped him in thick mist.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.445">Three times swift-footed brilliant Achilleus swept in against him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.446">with the brazen spear. Three times his stroke went into the deep mist.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.447">But as a fourth time, like something more than a man, he charged in,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.448">Achilleus with a terrible cry called in winged words after him:</p>
	<p id="IL.20.449">'Once again now you escaped death, dog. And yet the evil</p>
	<p id="IL.20.450">came near you, but now once more Phoibos Apollo has saved you,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.451">he to whom you must pray when you go into the thunder of spears thrown.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.452">Yet I may win you, if I encounter you ever hereafter,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.453">if beside me also there is some god who will help me.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.454">Now I must chase whoever I can overtake of the others.'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.455">He spoke, and with the spear full in the neck stabbed Dryops</p>
	<p id="IL.20.456">so that he dropped in front of his feet. He left him to lie there</p>
	<p id="IL.20.457">and with a spear thrown against the knee stopped the charge of Demouchos,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.458">Philetor's son, a huge man and powerful. After the spearcast</p>
	<p id="IL.20.459">with an inward plunge of the great sword he took the life from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.460">Then Achilleus swooping on Dardanos and Laogonos, sons both</p>
	<p id="IL.20.461">of Bias, dashed them to the ground from behind their horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.462">one with a spearcast, one with a stroke of the sword from close up.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.463">Now Tros, Alastor's son: he had come up against Achilleus'</p>
	<p id="IL.20.464">knees, to catch them and be spared and his life given to him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.465">if Achilleus might take pity upon his youth and not kill him;</p>
	<p id="IL.20.466">fool, and did not see there would be no way to persuade him,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.467">since this was a man with no sweetness in his heart, and not kindly</p>
	<p id="IL.20.468">but in a strong fury; now Tros with his hands was reaching</p>
	<p id="IL.20.469">for the knees, bent on supplication, but he stabbed with his sword at the liver</p>
	<p id="IL.20.470">so that the liver was torn from its place, and from it the black blood</p>
	<p id="IL.20.471">drenched the fold of his tunic and his eyes were shrouded in darkness</p>
	<p id="IL.20.472">as the life went. Next from close in he thrust at Moulios</p>
	<p id="IL.20.473">with the pike at the ear, so the bronze spearhead pushed through and came out</p>
	<p id="IL.20.474">at the other ear. Now he hit Echeklos the son of Agenor</p>
	<p id="IL.20.475">with the hilted sword, hewing against his head in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.20.476">so all the sword was smoking with blood, and over both eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.20.477">closed the red death and the strong destiny. Now Deukalion</p>
	<p id="IL.20.478">was struck in the arm, at a place in the elbow where the tendons</p>
	<p id="IL.20.479">come together. There through the arm Achilleus transfixed him</p>
	<p id="IL.20.480">with the bronze spearhead, and he, arm hanging heavy, waited</p>
	<p id="IL.20.481">and looked his death in the face. Achilleus struck with the sword's edge</p>
	<p id="IL.20.482">at his neck, and swept the helmed head far away, and the marrow</p>
	<p id="IL.20.483">gushed from the neckbone, and he went down to the ground at full length.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.484">Now he went on after the blameless son of Peires,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.485">Rhigmos, who had come over from Thrace where the soil is rich. This man</p>
	<p id="IL.20.486">he stabbed in the middle with the spear, and the spear stuck fast in his belly.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.487">He dropped from the chariot, but as Areïthoös his henchman</p>
	<p id="IL.20.488">turned the horses away Achilleus stabbed him with the sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.20.489">in the back, and thrust him from the chariot. And the horses bolted.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.490">As inhuman fire sweeps on in fury through the deep angles</p>
	<p id="IL.20.491">of a drywood mountain and sets ablaze the depth of the timber</p>
	<p id="IL.20.492">and the blustering wind lashes the flame along, so Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.20.493">swept everywhere with his spear like something more than a mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.20.494">harrying them as they died, and the black earth ran blood.</p>
	<p id="IL.20.495">Or as when a man yokes male broad-foreheaded oxen</p>
	<p id="IL.20.496">to crush white barley on a strong-laid threshing floor, and rapidly</p>
	<p id="IL.20.497">the barley is stripped beneath the feet of the bellowing oxen,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.498">so before great-hearted Achilleus the single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.20.499">trampled alike dead men and shields, and the axle under</p>
	<p id="IL.20.500">the chariot was all splashed with blood and the rails which encircled</p>
	<p id="IL.20.501">the chariot, struck by flying drops from the feet of the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.20.502">from the running rims of the wheels. The son of Peleus was straining</p>
	<p id="IL.20.503">to win glory, his invincible hands spattered with bloody filth.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.1">BUT when they came to the crossing place of the fair-running river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.2">of whirling Xanthos, a stream whose father was Zeus the immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.3">there Achilleus split them and chased some back over the flat land</p>
	<p id="IL.21.4">toward the city, where the Achaians themselves had stampeded in terror</p>
	<p id="IL.21.5">on the day before, when glorious Hektor was still in his fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.6">Along this ground they were streaming in flight; but Hera let fall</p>
	<p id="IL.21.7">a deep mist before them to stay them. Meanwhile the other half</p>
	<p id="IL.21.8">were crowded into the silvery whirls of the deep-running river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.9">and tumbled into it in huge clamour, and the steep-running water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.10">sounded, and the banks echoed hugely about them, as they out-crying</p>
	<p id="IL.21.11">tried to swim this way and that, spun about in the eddies.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.12">As before the blast of a fire the locusts escaping</p>
	<p id="IL.21.13">into a river swarm in air, and the fire unwearied</p>
	<p id="IL.21.14">blazes from a sudden start, and the locusts huddle in water;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.15">so before Achilleus the murmuring waters of Xanthos</p>
	<p id="IL.21.16">the deep-whirling were filled with confusion of men and of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.17">But heaven-descended Achilleus left his spear there on the bank</p>
	<p id="IL.21.18">leaning against the tamarisks, and leapt in like some immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.19">with only his sword, but his heart was bent upon evil actions,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.20">and he struck in a circle around him. The shameful sound of their groaning</p>
	<p id="IL.21.21">rose as they were struck with the sword, and the water was reddened</p>
	<p id="IL.21.22">with blood. As before a huge-gaping dolphin the other fishes</p>
	<p id="IL.21.23">escaping cram the corners of a deepwater harbour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.24">in fear, for he avidly eats up any he can catch;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.25">so the Trojans along the course of the terrible river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.26">shrank under the bluffs. He, when his hands grew weary with killing,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.27">chose out and took twelve young men alive from the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.28">to be vengeance for the death of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.29">These, bewildered with fear like fawns, he led out of the water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.30">and bound their hands behind them with thongs well cut out of leather,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.31">with the very belts they themselves wore on their ingirt tunics,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.32">and gave them to his companions to lead away to the hollow ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.33">then himself whirled back, still in a fury to kill men.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.34">And there he came upon a son of Dardanian Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.21.35">as he escaped from the river, Lykaon, one whom he himself</p>
	<p id="IL.21.36">had taken before and led him unwilling from his father's gardens</p>
	<p id="IL.21.37">on a night foray. He with the sharp bronze was cutting young branches</p>
	<p id="IL.21.38">from a fig tree, so that they could make him rails for a chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.39">when an unlooked-for evil thing came upon him, the brilliant</p>
	<p id="IL.21.40">Achilleus, who that time sold him as slave in strong-founded Lemnos</p>
	<p id="IL.21.41">carrying him there by ship, and the son of Jason paid for him;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.42">from there a guest and friend who paid a great price redeemed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.43">Eëtion of Imbros, and sent him to shining Arisbe;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.44">and from there he fled away and came to the house of his father.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.45">For eleven days he pleasured his heart with friends and family</p>
	<p id="IL.21.46">after he got back from Lemnos, but on the twelfth day once again</p>
	<p id="IL.21.47">the god cast him into the hands of Achilleus, who this time</p>
	<p id="IL.21.48">was to send him down unwilling on his way to the death god.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.49">Now as brilliant swift-footed Achilleus saw him and knew him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.50">naked and without helm or shield, and he had no spear left</p>
	<p id="IL.21.51">but had thrown all these things on the ground, being weary and sweating</p>
	<p id="IL.21.52">with the escape from the river, and his knees were beaten with weariness,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.53">disturbed, Achilleus spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.54">'Can this be? Here is a strange thing that my eyes look on.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.55">Now the great-hearted Trojans, even those I have killed already,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.56">will stand and rise up again out of the gloom and the darkness</p>
	<p id="IL.21.57">as this man has come back and escaped the day without pity</p>
	<p id="IL.21.58">though he was sold into sacred Lemnos; but the main of the grey sea</p>
	<p id="IL.21.59">could not hold him, though it holds back many who are unwilling.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.60">But come now, he must be given a taste of our spearhead</p>
	<p id="IL.21.61">so that I may know inside my heart and make certain</p>
	<p id="IL.21.62">whether he will come back even from there, or the prospering</p>
	<p id="IL.21.63">earth will hold him, she who holds back even the strong man.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.64">So he pondered, waiting, and the other in terror came near him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.65">in an agony to catch at his knees, and the wish in his heart was</p>
	<p id="IL.21.66">to get away from the evil death and the dark fate. By this</p>
	<p id="IL.21.67">brilliant Achilleus held the long spear uplifted above him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.68">straining to stab, but he under-ran the stroke and caught him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.69">by the knees, bending, and the spear went over his back and stood fast</p>
	<p id="IL.21.70">in the ground, for all its desire to tear a man's flesh. Lykaon</p>
	<p id="IL.21.71">with one hand had taken him by the knees in supplication</p>
	<p id="IL.21.72">and with the other held and would not let go of the edged spear</p>
	<p id="IL.21.73">and spoke aloud to him and addressed him in winged words: 'Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.74">I am at your knees. Respect my position, have mercy upon me.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.75">I am in the place, illustrious, of a suppliant who must be honoured,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.76">for you were the first beside whom I tasted the yield of Demeter</p>
	<p id="IL.21.77">on that day you captured me in the strong-laid garden</p>
	<p id="IL.21.78">and took me away from my father and those near me, and sold me</p>
	<p id="IL.21.79">away into sacred Lemnos, and a hundred oxen I fetched you.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.80">My release was ransom three times as great; and this is</p>
	<p id="IL.21.81">the twelfth dawn since I came back to Ilion, after</p>
	<p id="IL.21.82">much suffering. Now again cursed destiny has put me</p>
	<p id="IL.21.83">in your hands; and I think I must be hated by Zeus the father</p>
	<p id="IL.21.84">who has given me once more to you, and my mother bore me</p>
	<p id="IL.21.85">to a short life, Laothoë, daughter of aged Altes,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.86">Altes, lord of the Leleges, whose delight is in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.87">and holds headlong Pedasos on the river Satnioeis.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.88">His daughter was given to Priam, who had many wives beside her.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.89">We are two who were born to her. You will have cut the throats</p>
	<p id="IL.21.90">of both, since one you beat down in the forefront of the foot-fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.91">Polydoros the godlike, with a cast of the sharp spear. This time</p>
	<p id="IL.21.92">the evil shall be mine in this place, since I do not think</p>
	<p id="IL.21.93">I shall escape your hands, since divinity drove me against them.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.94">Still, put away in your heart this other thing I say to you.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.95">Do not kill me. I am not from the same womb as Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.96">he who killed your powerful and kindly companion.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.97">So the glorious son of Priam addressed him, speaking</p>
	<p id="IL.21.98">in supplication, but heard in turn the voice without pity:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.99">'Poor fool, no longer speak to me of ransom, nor argue it.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.100">In the time before Patroklos came to the day of his destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.21.101">then it was the way of my heart's choice to be sparing</p>
	<p id="IL.21.102">of the Trojans, and many I took alive and disposed of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.103">Now there is not one who can escape death, if the gods send</p>
	<p id="IL.21.104">him against my hands in front of Ilion, not one</p>
	<p id="IL.21.105">of all the Trojans and beyond others the children of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.106">So, friend, you die also. Why all this clamour about it?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.107">Patroklos also is dead, who was better by far than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.108">Do you not see what a man I am, how huge, how splendid</p>
	<p id="IL.21.109">and born of a great father, and the mother who bore me immortal?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.110">Yet even I have also my death and my strong destiny,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.111">and there shall be a dawn or an afternoon or a noontime</p>
	<p id="IL.21.112">when some man in the fighting will take the life from me also</p>
	<p id="IL.21.113">either with a spearcast or an arrow flown from the bowstring.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.114">So he spoke, and in the other the knees and the inward</p>
	<p id="IL.21.115">heart went slack. He let go of the spear and sat back, spreading</p>
	<p id="IL.21.116">wide both hands; but Achilleus drawing his sharp sword struck him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.117">beside the neck at the collar-bone, and the double-edged sword</p>
	<p id="IL.21.118">plunged full length inside. He dropped to the ground, face downward,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.119">and lay at length, and the black blood flowed, and the ground was soaked with it.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.120">Achilleus caught him by the foot and slung him into the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.121">to drift, and spoke winged words of vaunting derision over him:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.122">'Lie there now among the fish, who will lick the blood away</p>
	<p id="IL.21.123">from your wound, and care nothing for you, nor will your mother</p>
	<p id="IL.21.124">lay you on the death-bed and mourn over you, but Skamandros</p>
	<p id="IL.21.125">will carry you spinning down to the wide bend of the salt water.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.126">And a fish will break a ripple shuddering dark on the water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.127">as he rises to feed upon the shining fat of Lykaon.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.128">Die on, all; till we come to the city of sacred Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.129">you in flight and I killing you from behind; and there will not</p>
	<p id="IL.21.130">be any rescue for you from your silvery-whirled strong-running</p>
	<p id="IL.21.131">river, for all the numbers of bulls you dedicate to it</p>
	<p id="IL.21.132">and drown single-foot horses alive in its eddies. And yet</p>
	<p id="IL.21.133">even so, die all an evil death, till all of you</p>
	<p id="IL.21.134">pay for the death of Patroklos and the slaughter of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.21.135">whom you killed beside the running ships, when I was not with them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.136">He spoke, but the anger was rising now in the heart of the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.137">and he pondered in his heart as to how he could stop the labour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.138">of brilliant Achilleus, and fend destruction away from the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.139">And now with the spear far shadowing in his hands Peleus' son</p>
	<p id="IL.21.140">was springing, furious to kill him, on Asteropaios</p>
	<p id="IL.21.141">the son of Pelegon; who in turn was born of the wide-running river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.142">Axios, and of Periboia, eldest of the daughters</p>
	<p id="IL.21.143">of Akessamenos, for she lay in love with the deep-whirling river.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.144">Against this man Achilleus rose up, and he came out to face him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.145">from the river, holding two spears, for Xanthos had inspired valour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.146">into his heart, in anger for the slaughter of the young men</p>
	<p id="IL.21.147">whom Achilleus had slain beside his waters and taken no pity.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.148">Now as these two in their advance encountered together</p>
	<p id="IL.21.149">first of the two to speak was swift-footed brilliant Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.150">'What man are you, and whence, who dare stand up to my onset?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.151">Since unhappy are those whose sons match warcraft against me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.152">Then in turn the glorious son of Pelegon answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.153">'High-hearted son of Peleus, why ask of my generation?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.154">I am from Paionia far away, where the soil is generous,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.155">and lead the men of Paionia with long spears; and this for me</p>
	<p id="IL.21.156">is the eleventh day since I arrived in Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.157">For my generation, it is from the broad waters of Axios,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.158">Axios, who floods the land with the loveliest waters.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.159">His son was Pelegon the spear-famed; but men say I am Pelegon's</p>
	<p id="IL.21.160">son; now, glorious Achilleus, we shall fight together.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.161">So he spoke, challenging, and brilliant Achilleus uplifted</p>
	<p id="IL.21.162">the Pelian ash spear, but the warrior Asteropaios</p>
	<p id="IL.21.163">threw with both spears at the same time, being ambidextrous.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.164">With the one spear he hit the shield but could not altogether</p>
	<p id="IL.21.165">break through the shield, since the gold stayed it that the god had given.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.166">With the other spear he struck Achilleus on the right forearm</p>
	<p id="IL.21.167">and grazed it so that the blood gushed out in a dark cloud, and the spear</p>
	<p id="IL.21.168">overpassed him and fixed in the ground, straining to reach his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.169">Throwing second Achilleus let fly at Asteropaios</p>
	<p id="IL.21.170">with the straight-flying ash spear in a fury to kill him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.171">but missed his man and hit the high bank, so that the ash spear</p>
	<p id="IL.21.172">was driven half its length and stuck in the bank of the river.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.173">But the son of Peleus, drawing from beside his thigh the sharp sword,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.174">sprang upon him in fury; and Asteropaios could not</p>
	<p id="IL.21.175">with his heavy hand wrench Achilleus' ash spear free of the river-bank.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.176">Three times he struggled straining to wrench it clear, and three times</p>
	<p id="IL.21.177">gave over the effort, and now for the fourth time he was bending</p>
	<p id="IL.21.178">over the ash spear of Aiakides, trying to break it,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.179">but before this Achilleus took his life with the sword from close up</p>
	<p id="IL.21.180">for he struck him in the belly next the navel, and all his guts poured</p>
	<p id="IL.21.181">out on the ground, and a mist of darkness closed over both eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.21.182">as he gasped life out, and springing upon his chest Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.21.183">stripped his armour away and spoke in triumph above him:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.184">'Lie so: it is hard even for those sprung of a river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.185">to fight against the children of Kronos, whose strength is almighty.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.186">You said you were of the generation of the wide-running river,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.187">but I claim that I am of the generation of great Zeus.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.188">The man is my father who is lord over many Myrmidons,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.189">Peleus, Aiakos' son, but Zeus was the father of Aiakos.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.190">And as Zeus is stronger than rivers that run to the sea, so</p>
	<p id="IL.21.191">the generation of Zeus is made stronger than that of a river.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.192">For here is a great river beside you, if he were able</p>
	<p id="IL.21.193">to help; but it is not possible to fight Zeus, son of Kronos.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.194">Not powerful Acheloios matches his strength against Zeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.195">not the enormous strength of Ocean with his deep-running waters,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.196">Ocean, from whom all rivers are and the entire sea</p>
	<p id="IL.21.197">and all springs and all deep wells have their waters of him, yet</p>
	<p id="IL.21.198">even Ocean is afraid of the lightning of great Zeus</p>
	<p id="IL.21.199">and the dangerous thunderbolt when it breaks from the sky crashing.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.200">So he spoke, and pulled the bronze spear free of the river bluff</p>
	<p id="IL.21.201">and left him there, when he had torn the heart of life from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.202">sprawled in the sands and drenched in the dark water. And about</p>
	<p id="IL.21.203">Asteropaios the eels and the other fish were busy</p>
	<p id="IL.21.204">tearing him and nibbling the fat that lay by his kidneys.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.205">But Achilleus went on after the Paionians crested with horse-hair</p>
	<p id="IL.21.206">who had scattered in fear along the banks of the eddying river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.207">when they had seen their greatest man in the strong encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.21.208">gone down by force under the sword and the hands of Peleïdes.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.209">There he killed Thersilochos and Astypylos and Mydon,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.210">Mnesos and Thrasios, and Ainios and Ophelestes.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.211">Now swift Achilleus would have killed even more Paionians</p>
	<p id="IL.21.212">except that the deep-whirling river spoke to him in anger</p>
	<p id="IL.21.213">and in mortal likeness, and the voice rose from the depth of the eddies:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.214">'O Achilleus, your strength is greater, your acts more violent</p>
	<p id="IL.21.215">than all men's; since always the very gods are guarding you.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.216">If the son of Kronos has given all Trojans to your destruction,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.217">drive them at least out of me to the plain, and there work your havoc.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.218">For the loveliness of my waters is crammed with corpses, I cannot</p>
	<p id="IL.21.219">find a channel to cast my waters into the bright sea</p>
	<p id="IL.21.220">since I am congested with the dead men you kill so brutally.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.221">Let me alone, then; lord of the people, I am confounded.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.222">Then in answer to him spoke Achilleus of the swift feet:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.223">'All this, illustrious Skamandros, shall be as you order.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.224">But I will not leave off my killing of the proud Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.21.225">until I have penned them inside their city, and attempted Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.21.226">strength against strength, until he has killed me or I have killed him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.227">He spoke, and like something more than mortal swept down on the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.228">And now the deep-whirling river called aloud to Apollo:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.229">'Shame, lord of the silver bow, Zeus' son; you have not kept</p>
	<p id="IL.21.230">the counsels of Kronion, who very strongly ordered you</p>
	<p id="IL.21.231">to stand by the Trojans and defend them, until the sun setting</p>
	<p id="IL.21.232">at last goes down and darkens all the generous ploughland.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.233">He spoke: and spear-famed Achilleus leapt into the middle water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.234">with a spring from the bluff, but the river in a boiling surge was upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.235">and rose making turbulent all his waters, and pushed off</p>
	<p id="IL.21.236">the many dead men whom Achilleus had killed piled in abundance</p>
	<p id="IL.21.237">in the stream; these, bellowing like a bull, he shoved out</p>
	<p id="IL.21.238">on the dry land, but saved the living in the sweet waters</p>
	<p id="IL.21.239">hiding them under the huge depths of the whirling current.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.240">And about Achilleus in his confusion a dangerous wave rose</p>
	<p id="IL.21.241">up, and beat against his shield and pushed it. He could not</p>
	<p id="IL.21.242">brace himself with his feet, but caught with his hands at an elm tree</p>
	<p id="IL.21.243">tall and strong grown, but this uptorn by the roots and tumbling</p>
	<p id="IL.21.244">ripped away the whole cliff and with its dense tangle of roots stopped</p>
	<p id="IL.21.245">the run of the lovely current and fallen full length in the water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.246">dammed the very stream. Achilleus uprising out of the whirlpool</p>
	<p id="IL.21.247">made a dash to get to the plain in the speed of his quick feet</p>
	<p id="IL.21.248">in fear, but the great god would not let him be, but rose on him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.249">in a darkening edge of water, minded to stop the labour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.250">of brilliant Achilleus and fend destruction away from the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.251">The son of Peleus sprang away the length of a spearcast</p>
	<p id="IL.21.252">running with the speed of the black eagle, the marauder</p>
	<p id="IL.21.253">who is at once the strongest of flying things and the swiftest.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.254">In the likeness of this he sped away, on his chest the bronze armour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.255">clashed terribly, and bending away to escape from the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.256">he fled, but the river came streaming after him in huge noise.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.257">And as a man running a channel from a spring of dark water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.258">guides the run of the water among his plants and his gardens</p>
	<p id="IL.21.259">with a mattock in his hand and knocks down the blocks in the channel;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.260">in the rush of the water all the pebbles beneath are torn loose</p>
	<p id="IL.21.261">from place, and the water that has been dripping suddenly jets on</p>
	<p id="IL.21.262">in a steep place and goes too fast even for the man who guides it;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.263">so always the crest of the river was overtaking Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.21.264">for all his speed of foot, since gods are stronger than mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.265">And every time swift-footed brilliant Achilleus would begin</p>
	<p id="IL.21.266">to turn and stand and fight the river, and try to discover</p>
	<p id="IL.21.267">if all the gods who hold the wide heaven were after him, every</p>
	<p id="IL.21.268">time again the enormous wave of the sky-fed river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.269">would strike his shoulders from above. He tried, in his desperation,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.270">to keep a high spring with his feet, but the river was wearing his knees out</p>
	<p id="IL.21.271">as it ran fiercely beneath him and cut the ground from under</p>
	<p id="IL.21.272">his feet. Peleïdes groaned aloud, gazing into the wide sky:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.273">'Father Zeus, no god could endure to save me from the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.274">who am so pitiful. And what then shall become of me?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.275">It is not so much any other Uranian god who has done this</p>
	<p id="IL.21.276">but my own mother who beguiled me with falsehoods, who told me</p>
	<p id="IL.21.277">that underneath the battlements of the armoured Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.21.278">I should be destroyed by the flying shafts of Apollo.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.279">I wish now Hektor had killed me, the greatest man grown in this place.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.280">A brave man would have been the slayer, as the slain was a brave man.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.281">But now this is a dismal death I am doomed to be caught in,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.282">trapped in a big river as if I were a boy and a swineherd</p>
	<p id="IL.21.283">swept away by a torrent when he tries to cross in a rainstorm.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.284">So he spoke, and Poseidon and Athene swiftly came near him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.285">and stood beside him with their shapes in the likeness of mortals</p>
	<p id="IL.21.286">and caught him hand by hand and spoke to him in assurance.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.287">First of them to speak was the shaker of the earth, Poseidon.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.288">'Do not be afraid, son of Peleus, nor be so anxious,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.289">such are we two of the gods who stand beside you to help you,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.290">by the consent of Zeus, myself and Pallas Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.291">Thereby it is not your destiny to be killed by the river,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.292">but he shall be presently stopped, and you yourself shall behold it.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.293">'But we also have close counsel to give you, if you will believe us.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.294">Do not let stay your hands from the collision of battle</p>
	<p id="IL.21.295">until you have penned the people of Troy, those who escape you,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.296">inside the famed wall of Ilion. Then when you have taken Hektor's life</p>
	<p id="IL.21.297">go back again to the ships. We grant you the winning of glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.298">So speaking the two went back again among the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.299">but Achilleus went on, and the urgency of the gods strongly stirred him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.300">into the plain. But the river filled with an outrush of water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.301">and masses of splendid armour from the young men who had perished</p>
	<p id="IL.21.302">floated there, and their bodies, but against the hard drive of the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.303">straight on he kept a high spring with his feet, and the river wide running</p>
	<p id="IL.21.304">could not stop him now, since he was given great strength by Athene.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.305">But Skamandros did not either abate his fury, but all the more</p>
	<p id="IL.21.306">raged at Peleion, and high uplifting the wave of his waters</p>
	<p id="IL.21.307">gathered it to a crest, and called aloud upon Simoeis:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.308">'Beloved brother, let even the two of us join to hold back</p>
	<p id="IL.21.309">the strength of a man, since presently he will storm the great city</p>
	<p id="IL.21.310">of lord Priam. The Trojans cannot stand up to him in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.311">But help me beat him off with all speed, and make full your currents</p>
	<p id="IL.21.312">with water from your springs, and rouse up all of your torrents</p>
	<p id="IL.21.313">and make a big wave rear up and wake the heavy confusion</p>
	<p id="IL.21.314">and sound of timbers and stones, so we can stop this savage man</p>
	<p id="IL.21.315">who is now in his strength and rages in fury like the immortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.316">For I say that his strength will not be enough for him nor his beauty</p>
	<p id="IL.21.317">nor his arms in their splendour, which somewhere deep down under the waters</p>
	<p id="IL.21.318">shall lie folded under the mud; and I will whelm his own body</p>
	<p id="IL.21.319">deep, and pile it over with abundance of sands and rubble</p>
	<p id="IL.21.320">numberless, nor shall the Achaians know where to look for</p>
	<p id="IL.21.321">his bones to gather them, such ruin will I pile over him.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.322">And there shall his monument be made, and he will have no need</p>
	<p id="IL.21.323">of any funeral mound to be buried in by the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.324">He spoke, and rose against Achilleus, turbulent, boiling</p>
	<p id="IL.21.325">to a crest, muttering in foam and blood and dead bodies</p>
	<p id="IL.21.326">until the purple wave of the river fed from the bright sky</p>
	<p id="IL.21.327">lifted high and caught in its waters the son of Peleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.328">But Hera, greatly fearing for Achilleus, cried in a loud voice</p>
	<p id="IL.21.329">lest he be swept away in the huge deep-eddying river,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.330">and at once thereafter appealed to her own dear son, Hephaistos:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.331">'Rise up, god of the dragging feet, my child; for we believe</p>
	<p id="IL.21.332">that whirling Xanthos would be fit antagonist for you in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.333">Go now quickly to the help of Achilleus, make shine a great flame</p>
	<p id="IL.21.334">while I raise up and bring in out of the sea a troublesome</p>
	<p id="IL.21.335">storm of the west wind and the whitening south wind, a storm</p>
	<p id="IL.21.336">that will burn the heads of the Trojans and burn their armour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.337">carrying the evil flame, while you by the banks of Xanthos</p>
	<p id="IL.21.338">set fire to the trees and throw fire on the river himself, and do not</p>
	<p id="IL.21.339">by any means let him turn you with winning words or revilements.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.340">Do not let your fury be stopped until such time as</p>
	<p id="IL.21.341">I lift my voice and cry to you. Then stay your weariless burning.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.342">Hera spoke, and Hephaistos set on them an inhuman fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.343">First he kindled a fire in the plain and burned the numerous</p>
	<p id="IL.21.344">corpses that lay there in abundance, slain by Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.345">and all the plain was parched and the shining water was straitened.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.346">As when the north wind of autumn suddenly makes dry</p>
	<p id="IL.21.347">a garden freshly watered and makes glad the man who is tending it,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.348">so the entire flat land was dried up with Hephaistos burning</p>
	<p id="IL.21.349">the dead bodies. Then he turned his flame in its shining</p>
	<p id="IL.21.350">into the river. The elms burned, the willows and tamarisks,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.351">the clover burned and the rushes and the galingale, all those</p>
	<p id="IL.21.352">plants that grew in abundance by the lovely stream of the river.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.353">The eels were suffering and the fish in the whirl of the water</p>
	<p id="IL.21.354">who leaped out along the lovely waters in every direction</p>
	<p id="IL.21.355">in affliction under the hot blast of resourceful Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.356">The strength of the river was burning away; he gave voice and called out</p>
	<p id="IL.21.357">by name: 'Hephaistos, not one of the gods could stand up against you.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.358">I for one could not fight the flame of a fire like this one.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.359">Leave your attack. Brilliant Achilleus can capture the city</p>
	<p id="IL.21.360">of the Trojans, now, for me. What have I to do with this quarrel?'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.361">He spoke, blazing with fire, and his lovely waters were seething.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.362">And as a cauldron that is propped over a great fire boils up</p>
	<p id="IL.21.363">dancing on its whole circle with dry sticks burning beneath it</p>
	<p id="IL.21.364">as it melts down the fat of swine made tender, so Xanthos'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.365">lovely streams were burned with the fire, and the water was boiling</p>
	<p id="IL.21.366">and would not flow along but was stopped under stress of the hot blast</p>
	<p id="IL.21.367">strongly blown by resourceful Hephaistos. And now the river</p>
	<p id="IL.21.368">cried out to Hera in the winged words of strong supplication:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.369">'Hera, why did your son assault me to trouble my waters</p>
	<p id="IL.21.370">beyond others'? It is not so much I who have done anything against you</p>
	<p id="IL.21.371">as all the rest of the gods who stand by to help the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.372">Now indeed I will leave off, if such is your order,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.373">but let him leave off too, I will swear you a promise</p>
	<p id="IL.21.374">not ever to drive the day of evil away from the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.375">not even when all the city of Troy is burned in the ravening</p>
	<p id="IL.21.376">fire, on that day when the warlike sons of the Achaians burn it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.377">Now when the goddess of the white arms, Hera, had heard this</p>
	<p id="IL.21.378">immediately she spoke to her own dear son, Hephaistos:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.379">'Hephaistos, hold, my glorious child, since it is not fitting</p>
	<p id="IL.21.380">to batter thus an immortal god for the sake of mortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.381">So she spoke, and Hephaistos quenched his inhuman fire. Now</p>
	<p id="IL.21.382">the lovely waters ran their ripples back in the channel.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.383">But when the strength of Xanthos had been beaten, these two gods</p>
	<p id="IL.21.384">rested, since Hera, for all she was still angry, restrained them.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.385">But upon the other gods descended the wearisome burden</p>
	<p id="IL.21.386">of hatred, and the wind of their fury blew from division,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.387">and they collided with a grand crash, the broad earth echoing</p>
	<p id="IL.21.388">and the huge sky sounded as with trumpets. Zeus heard it</p>
	<p id="IL.21.389">from where he sat on Olympos, and was amused in his deep heart</p>
	<p id="IL.21.390">for pleasure, as he watched the gods' collision in conflict.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.391">Thereafter they stood not long apart from each other, for Ares</p>
	<p id="IL.21.392">began it, the shield-stabber, and rose up against Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.21.393">with the brazen spear in his hand, and spoke a word of revilement:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.394">'Why once more, you dogfly, have you stirred up trouble among the gods</p>
	<p id="IL.21.395">with the blast of your blown fury, and the pride of your heart driving you?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.396">Do you not remember how you set on Diomedes, Tydeus'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.397">son, to spear me, and yourself laying hold of the far-seen pike</p>
	<p id="IL.21.398">pushed it straight into me and tore my skin in its beauty.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.399">So now I am minded to pay you back for all you have done me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.400">He spoke, and stabbed against the ghastly aegis with fluttering</p>
	<p id="IL.21.401">straps, which gives way not even before the bolt of Zeus' lightning.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.402">There blood-dripping Ares made his stab with the long spear,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.403">but Athene giving back caught up in her heavy hand a stone</p>
	<p id="IL.21.404">that lay in the plain, black and rugged and huge, one which men</p>
	<p id="IL.21.405">of a former time had set there as boundary mark of the cornfield.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.406">With this she hit furious Ares in the neck, and unstrung him.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.407">He spread over seven acres in his fall, and his hair dragged</p>
	<p id="IL.21.408">in the dust, and his armour clashed. But Pallas Athene laughing</p>
	<p id="IL.21.409">stood above him and spoke to him in the winged words of triumph:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.410">'You child; you did not think even this time how much stronger</p>
	<p id="IL.21.411">I can claim I am than you, when you match your fury against me.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.412">Therefore you are paying atonement to your mother's furies</p>
	<p id="IL.21.413">since she is angry and wishes you ill, because you abandoned</p>
	<p id="IL.21.414">the Achaians, and have given your aid to the insolent Trojans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.415">She spoke, and turned the shining of her eyes away. But taking</p>
	<p id="IL.21.416">Ares by the hand the daughter of Zeus, Aphrodite,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.417">led him away, groaning always, his strength scarce gathered back into him.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.418">But now, as the goddess of the white arms, Hera, noticed her</p>
	<p id="IL.21.419">immediately she spoke to Pallas Athene her winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.420">'For shame now, Atrytone, daughter of Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.421">Here again is this dogfly leading murderous Ares</p>
	<p id="IL.21.422">out of the fighting and through the confusion. Quick, go after her!'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.423">She spoke, and Athene swept in pursuit, heart full of gladness,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.424">and caught up with her and drove a blow at her breasts with her ponderous</p>
	<p id="IL.21.425">hand, so that her knees went slack and the heart inside her.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.426">Those two both lay sprawled on the generous earth. But Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.21.427">stood above them and spoke to them in the winged words of triumph:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.428">'Now may all who bring their aid to the Trojans be in</p>
	<p id="IL.21.429">such case as these, when they do battle with the armoured Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.430">as daring and as unfortunate, as now Aphrodite</p>
	<p id="IL.21.431">came companion in arms to Ares, and faced my fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.432">So we should long ago have rested after our fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.21.433">once having utterly stormed the strong-founded city of Ilion.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.434">She spoke, and the goddess of the white arms, Hera, smiled on her.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.435">But now the powerful shaker of the earth spoke to Apollo:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.436">'Phoibos, why do you and I stand yet apart. It does not suit</p>
	<p id="IL.21.437">when the others have begun, and it were too shameful if without fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.21.438">we go back to the brazen house of Zeus on Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.439">Begin, you; you are younger born than I; it is not well</p>
	<p id="IL.21.440">for me to, since I am elder born than you, and know more.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.441">Young fool, what a mindless heart you have. Can you not even</p>
	<p id="IL.21.442">now remember all the evils we endured here by Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.443">you and I alone of the gods, when to proud Laomedon</p>
	<p id="IL.21.444">we came down from Zeus and for a year were his servants</p>
	<p id="IL.21.445">for a stated hire, and he told us what to do, and to do it?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.446">Then I built a wall for the Trojans about their city,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.447">wide, and very splendid, so none could break into their city,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.448">but you, Phoibos, herded his shambling horn-curved cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.21.449">along the spurs of Ida with all her folds and her forests.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.450">But when the changing seasons brought on the time for our labour</p>
	<p id="IL.21.451">to be paid, then headstrong Laomedon violated and made void</p>
	<p id="IL.21.452">all our hire, and sent us away, and sent threats after us.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.453">For he threatened to hobble our feet and to bind our arms,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.454">to carry us away for slaves in the far-lying islands.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.455">He was even going to strip with bronze the ears from both of us.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.456">Then you and I took our way back with hearts full of anger</p>
	<p id="IL.21.457">and wrath for our hire which he promised us and would not accomplish it.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.458">Yet to his people you give now your grace, and you will not</p>
	<p id="IL.21.459">try with us to bring destruction on the insolent Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.21.460">evil and complete, with their honoured wives and their children.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.461">In turn the lord who strikes from afar, Apollo, answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.462">'Shaker of the earth, you would have me be as one without prudence</p>
	<p id="IL.21.463">if I am to fight even you for the sake of insignificant</p>
	<p id="IL.21.464">mortals, who are as leaves are, and now flourish and grow warm</p>
	<p id="IL.21.465">with life, and feed on what the ground gives, but then again</p>
	<p id="IL.21.466">fade away and are dead. Therefore let us with all speed</p>
	<p id="IL.21.467">give up this quarrel and let the mortals fight their own battles.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.468">He spoke so and turned away, for he was too modest</p>
	<p id="IL.21.469">to close and fight in strength of hand with his father's brother.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.470">But his sister, Artemis of the wild, the lady of wild beasts,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.471">scolded him bitterly and spoke a word of revilement:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.472">'You run from him, striker from afar. You have yielded Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.21.473">the victory entire. He can brag, where nothing has happened.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.474">Fool, then why do you wear that bow, which is wind and nothing.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.475">Let me not hear you in the halls of my father boasting</p>
	<p id="IL.21.476">ever again, as you did before among the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.477">that you could match your strength in combat against Poseidon.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.478">So she spoke, but Apollo who strikes from afar said nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.21.479">to her; but the august consort of Zeus, full of anger,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.480">scolded the lady of showering arrows in words of revilement:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.481">'How have you had the daring, you shameless hussy, to stand up</p>
	<p id="IL.21.482">and face me? It will be hard for you to match your strength with mine</p>
	<p id="IL.21.483">even if you wear a bow, since Zeus has made you a lion</p>
	<p id="IL.21.484">among women, and given you leave to kill any at your pleasure.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.485">Better for you to hunt down the ravening beasts in the mountains</p>
	<p id="IL.21.486">and deer of the wilds, than try to fight in strength with your betters.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.487">But if you would learn what fighting is, come on. You will find out</p>
	<p id="IL.21.488">how much stronger I am when you try to match strength against me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.489">She spoke, and caught both of her arms at the wrists in her left hand</p>
	<p id="IL.21.490">and with her right hand stripped away the bow from her shoulders,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.491">then with her own bow, smiling, boxed her ears as Artemis</p>
	<p id="IL.21.492">tried to twist away, and the flying arrows were scattered.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.493">She got under and free and fled in tears, as a pigeon</p>
	<p id="IL.21.494">in flight from a hawk wings her way into some rock-hollow</p>
	<p id="IL.21.495">and a cave, since it was not destiny for the hawk to catch her.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.496">So she left her archery on the ground, and fled weeping.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.497">Meanwhile the Guide, Argeïphontes, addressed him to Leto:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.498">'Leto, I will not fight with you; since it is a hard thing</p>
	<p id="IL.21.499">to come to blows with the brides of Zeus who gathers the clouds. No,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.500">sooner you may freely speak among the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.21.501">gods, and claim that you were stronger than I, and beat me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.502">So he spoke, but Leto picked up the curved bow and the arrows</p>
	<p id="IL.21.503">which had fallen in the turn of the dust one way and another.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.504">When she had taken up the bow she went back to her daughter.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.505">But the maiden came to the bronze-founded house on Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.21.506">of Zeus, and took her place kneeling at the knees of her father</p>
	<p id="IL.21.507">and the ambrosial veil trembled about her. Her father</p>
	<p id="IL.21.508">Kronides caught her against him, and laughed softly, and questioned her:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.509">'Who now of the Uranian gods, dear child, has done such</p>
	<p id="IL.21.510">things to you, rashly, as if you were caught doing something wicked?'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.511">Artemis sweet-garlanded lady of clamours answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.512">'It was your wife, Hera of the white arms, who hit me,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.513">father, since hatred and fighting have fastened upon the immortals.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.514">Now as these two were talking thus to each other, meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.21.515">Phoibos Apollo went into the sacred city of Ilion,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.516">since he was concerned for the wall of the strong-founded city</p>
	<p id="IL.21.517">lest the Danaans storm it on that day, before they were fated.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.518">The rest of the gods who live forever went back to Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.519">some in anger and others glorying greatly, and sat down</p>
	<p id="IL.21.520">at the side of their father the dark-misted. Meanwhile Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.21.521">was destroying alike the Trojans themselves and their single-foot horses;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.522">and as when smoke ascending goes up into the wide sky</p>
	<p id="IL.21.523">from a burning city, with the anger of the gods let loose upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.21.524">which inflicted labour upon them all, and sorrow on many,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.525">so Achilleus inflicted labour and sorrow upon the Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.526">The aged Priam had taken his place on the god-built bastion,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.527">and looked out and saw gigantic Achilleus, where before him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.528">the Trojans fled in the speed of their confusion, no war strength</p>
	<p id="IL.21.529">left them. He groaned and descended to the ground from the bastion</p>
	<p id="IL.21.530">and beside the wall set in motion the glorious guards of the gateway;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.531">'Hold the gates wide open in your hands, so that our people</p>
	<p id="IL.21.532">in their flight can get inside the city, for here is Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.21.533">close by, stampeding them, and I think there will be disaster.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.534">But once they are crowded inside the city and get wind again,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.535">shut once more the door-leaves closely fitted together.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.536">I am afraid this ruinous man may spring into our stronghold.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.537">He spoke, and they spread open the gates and shoved back the door bars</p>
	<p id="IL.21.538">and the gates opening let in daylight. Meanwhile Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.21.539">sprang out to meet them, so that he could fend off destruction</p>
	<p id="IL.21.540">from the Trojans, who, straight for the city and the lift of the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.21.541">dusty from the plain and throats rugged with thirst, fled</p>
	<p id="IL.21.542">away, and Achilleus followed fiercely with the spear, strong madness</p>
	<p id="IL.21.543">forever holding his heart and violent after his glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.544">There the sons of the Achaians might have taken gate-towering Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.21.545">had not Phoibos Apollo sent on them brilliant Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.546">a man who was the son of Antenor, blameless and powerful.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.547">He drove courage into his heart, and stood there beside him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.548">in person, so as to beat the dragging death spirits from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.549">and leaned there on an oak tree with close mist huddled about him.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.550">When Agenor was aware of Achilleus, sacker of cities,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.551">he stood fast, but the heart was a storm in him as he waited,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.552">and deeply disturbed he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.553">'Ah me! if I run away before the strength of Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.21.554">in the way that others are stampeded in terror before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.555">he will catch me even so and cut my throat like a coward's.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.556">But if I leave these men to be driven in flight by Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.557">Peleus' son, and run on my feet in another direction</p>
	<p id="IL.21.558">away from the wall to the plain of Ilion, until I come to</p>
	<p id="IL.21.559">the spurs of Ida, and take cover there within the undergrowth,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.560">then in the evening, when I have bathed in the river, and washed off</p>
	<p id="IL.21.561">the sweat, I could make my way back again to Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.562">Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?</p>
	<p id="IL.21.563">This way, he might see me as I started to the plain from the city,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.564">and go in pursuit, and in the speed of his feet overtake me.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.565">Then there will be no way to escape death and the death spirits.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.566">He is too strong, his strength is beyond all others'. But then if</p>
	<p id="IL.21.567">I go out in front of the city and stand fast against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.568">I think even his body might be torn by the sharp bronze.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.569">There is only one life in him, and people say he is mortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.570">It is only that Zeus, the son of Kronos, is granting him glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.571">He spoke, and gathered himself to await Achilleus, and in him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.572">the fighting heart was urgent for the encounter of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.573">But as a leopard emerges out of her timbered cover</p>
	<p id="IL.21.574">to face the man who is hunting her, and takes no terror</p>
	<p id="IL.21.575">in her heart nor thought of flight when she hears them baying against her;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.576">and even though one be too quick for her with spear thrust or spear thrown</p>
	<p id="IL.21.577">stuck with the shaft though she be she will not give up her fighting</p>
	<p id="IL.21.578">fury, till she has closed with one of them or is overthrown;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.579">so the son of proud Antenor, brilliant Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.580">was unwilling to run away until he had tested Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.581">but held the perfect circle of his shield in front of him,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.582">and with the spear aimed at him and cried out in a great voice:</p>
	<p id="IL.21.583">'You must have hoped within your heart, o shining Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.584">on this day to storm the city of the proud Trojans.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.585">You fool! There is much hard suffering to be done for its winning,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.586">since there are many of us inside, and men who are fighters,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.587">who will stand before our beloved parents, our wives and our children,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.588">to defend Ilion; but in this place you will find your destiny,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.589">for all you are so headlong and so bold a warrior.'</p>
	<p id="IL.21.590">He spoke, and from his heavy hand let fly with the sharp spear</p>
	<p id="IL.21.591">and struck him in the leg below the knee, nor entirely</p>
	<p id="IL.21.592">missed him, and taking the spear the greave of new-wrought tin clattered</p>
	<p id="IL.21.593">horribly, and back from the struck greave the bronze rebounded</p>
	<p id="IL.21.594">without getting through, but the gift of the god defended Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.595">After him Peleus' son made his spring at godlike Agenor,</p>
	<p id="IL.21.596">but Apollo would no further grant him the winning of glory</p>
	<p id="IL.21.597">but caught Agenor away closing him in a dense mist</p>
	<p id="IL.21.598">and sent him to make his way quietly out of the battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.599">Then by deception he kept Peleion away from the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.600">The striker from afar likened himself in all ways to Agenor</p>
	<p id="IL.21.601">and stood there before his feet, and Achilleus sprang in chase of him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.602">in the speed of his feet; for the time he chased him across the wheat-bearing</p>
	<p id="IL.21.603">plain, turning him toward the deep whirls of the river Skamandros</p>
	<p id="IL.21.604">as he ran a little in front; with the trick Apollo beguiled him</p>
	<p id="IL.21.605">so that he hoped ever by running to catch up with him;</p>
	<p id="IL.21.606">all this time the rest of the Trojans fled in a body</p>
	<p id="IL.21.607">gladly into the town, and the city was filled with their swarming.</p>
	<p id="IL.21.608">They dared no longer outside the wall and outside the city</p>
	<p id="IL.21.609">to wait for each other and find out which one had got away</p>
	<p id="IL.21.610">and who had died in the battle, so hastily were they streaming</p>
	<p id="IL.21.611">into the city, each man as his knees and feet could rescue him.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.1">So along the city the Trojans, who had run like fawns, dried</p>
	<p id="IL.22.2">the sweat off from their bodies and drank and slaked their thirst, leaning</p>
	<p id="IL.22.3">along the magnificent battlements. Meanwhile the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.22.4">sloping their shields across their shoulders came close to the rampart.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.5">But his deadly fate held Hektor shackled, so that he stood fast</p>
	<p id="IL.22.6">in front of Ilion and the Skaian gates. Now Phoibos</p>
	<p id="IL.22.7">Apollo spoke aloud to Peleion: 'Why, son of Peleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.8">do you keep after me in the speed of your feet, being mortal</p>
	<p id="IL.22.9">while I am an immortal god? Even yet you have not</p>
	<p id="IL.22.10">seen that I am a god, but strain after me in your fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.11">Now hard fighting with the Trojans whom you stampeded means nothing</p>
	<p id="IL.22.12">to you. They are crowded in the city, but you bent away here.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.13">You will never kill me. I am not one who is fated.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.14">Deeply vexed Achilleus of the swift feet spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.15">'You have balked me, striker from afar, most malignant of all gods,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.16">when you turned me here away from the rampart, else many Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.22.17">would have caught the soil in their teeth before they got back into Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.18">Now you have robbed me of great glory, and rescued these people</p>
	<p id="IL.22.19">lightly, since you have no retribution to fear hereafter.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.20">Else I would punish you, if only the strength were in me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.21">He spoke, and stalked away against the city, with high thoughts</p>
	<p id="IL.22.22">in mind, and in tearing speed, like a racehorse with his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.22.23">who runs lightly as he pulls the chariot over the flat land.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.24">Such was the action of Achilleus in feet and quick knees.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.25">The aged Priam was the first of all whose eyes saw him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.26">as he swept across the flat land in full shining, like that star</p>
	<p id="IL.22.27">which comes on in the autumn and whose conspicuous brightness</p>
	<p id="IL.22.28">far outshines the stars that are numbered in the night's darkening,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.29">the star they give the name of Orion's Dog, which is brightest</p>
	<p id="IL.22.30">among the stars, and yet is wrought as a sign of evil</p>
	<p id="IL.22.31">and brings on the great fever for unfortunate mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.32">Such was the flare of the bronze that girt his chest in his running.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.33">The old man groaned aloud and with both hands high uplifted</p>
	<p id="IL.22.34">beat his head, and groaned amain, and spoke supplicating</p>
	<p id="IL.22.35">his beloved son, who there still in front of the gateway</p>
	<p id="IL.22.36">stood fast in determined fury to fight with Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.37">The old man stretching his hands out called pitifully to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.38">'Hektor, beloved child, do not wait the attack of this man</p>
	<p id="IL.22.39">alone, away from the others. You might encounter your destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.22.40">beaten down by Peleion, since he is far stronger than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.41">A hard man: I wish he were as beloved of the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.22.42">as loved by me. Soon he would lie dead, and the dogs and the vultures</p>
	<p id="IL.22.43">would eat him, and bitter sorrow so be taken from my heart.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.44">He has made me desolate of my sons, who were brave and many.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.45">He killed them, or sold them away among the far-lying islands.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.46">Even now there are two sons, Lykaon and Polydoros,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.47">whom I cannot see among the Trojans pent up in the city,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.48">sons Laothoëa princess among women bore to me.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.49">But if these are alive somewhere in the army, then I can</p>
	<p id="IL.22.50">set them free for bronze and gold; it is there inside, since</p>
	<p id="IL.22.51">Altes the aged and renowned gave much with his daughter.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.52">But if they are dead already and gone down to the house of Hades,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.53">it is sorrow to our hearts, who bore them, myself and their mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.54">but to the rest of the people a sorrow that will be fleeting</p>
	<p id="IL.22.55">beside their sorrow for you, if you go down before Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.56">Come then inside the wall, my child, so that you can rescue</p>
	<p id="IL.22.57">the Trojans and the women of Troy, neither win the high glory</p>
	<p id="IL.22.58">for Peleus' son, and yourself be robbed of your very life. Oh, take</p>
	<p id="IL.22.59">pity on me, the unfortunate still alive, still sentient</p>
	<p id="IL.22.60">but ill-starred, whom the father, Kronos' son, on the threshold of old age</p>
	<p id="IL.22.61">will blast with hard fate, after I have looked upon evils</p>
	<p id="IL.22.62">and seen my sons destroyed and my daughters dragged away captive</p>
	<p id="IL.22.63">and the chambers of marriage wrecked and the innocent children taken</p>
	<p id="IL.22.64">and dashed to the ground in the hatefulness of war, and the wives</p>
	<p id="IL.22.65">of my sons dragged off by the accursed hands of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.66">And myself last of all, my dogs in front of my doorway</p>
	<p id="IL.22.67">will rip me raw, after some man with stroke of the sharp bronze</p>
	<p id="IL.22.68">spear, or with spearcast, has torn the life out of my body;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.69">those dogs I raised in my halls to be at my table, to guard my</p>
	<p id="IL.22.70">gates, who will lap my blood in the savagery of their anger</p>
	<p id="IL.22.71">and then lie down in my courts. For a young man all is decorous</p>
	<p id="IL.22.72">when he is cut down in battle and torn with the sharp bronze, and lies there</p>
	<p id="IL.22.73">dead, and though dead still all that shows about him is beautiful;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.74">but when an old man is dead and down, and the dogs mutilate</p>
	<p id="IL.22.75">the grey head and the grey beard and the parts that are secret,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.76">this, for all sad mortality, is the sight most pitiful.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.77">So the old man spoke, and in his hands seizing the grey hairs</p>
	<p id="IL.22.78">tore them from his head, but could not move the spirit in Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.79">And side by side with him his mother in tears was mourning</p>
	<p id="IL.22.80">and laid the fold of her bosom bare and with one hand held out</p>
	<p id="IL.22.81">a breast, and wept her tears for him and called to him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.82">'Hektor, my child, look upon these and obey, and take pity</p>
	<p id="IL.22.83">on me, if ever I gave you the breast to quiet your sorrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.84">Remember all these things, dear child, and from inside the wall</p>
	<p id="IL.22.85">beat off this grim man. Do not go out as champion against him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.86">o hard one; for if he kills you I can no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.22.87">mourn you on the death-bed, sweet branch, o child of my bearing,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.88">nor can your generous wife mourn you, but a big way from us</p>
	<p id="IL.22.89">beside the ships of the Argives the running dogs will feed on you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.90">So these two in tears and with much supplication called out</p>
	<p id="IL.22.91">to their dear son, but could not move the spirit in Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.92">but he awaited Achilleus as he came on, gigantic.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.93">But as a snake waits for a man by his hole, in the mountains,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.94">glutted with evil poisons, and the fell venom has got inside him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.95">and coiled about the hole he stares malignant, so Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.22.96">would not give ground but kept unquenched the fury within him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.97">and sloped his shining shield against the jut of the bastion.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.98">Deeply troubled he spoke to his own great-hearted spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.99">'Ah me! If I go now inside the wall and the gateway,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.100">Poulydamas will be first to put a reproach upon me,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.101">since he tried to make me lead the Trojans inside the city</p>
	<p id="IL.22.102">on that accursed night when brilliant Achilleus rose up,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.103">and I would not obey him, but that would have been far better.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.104">Now, since by my own recklessness I have ruined my people,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.105">I feel shame before the Trojans and the Trojan women with trailing</p>
	<p id="IL.22.106">robes, that someone who is less of a man than I will say of me:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.107">"Hektor believed in his own strength and ruined his people."</p>
	<p id="IL.22.108">Thus they will speak; and as for me, it would be much better</p>
	<p id="IL.22.109">at that time, to go against Achilleus, and slay him, and come back,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.110">or else be killed by him in glory in front of the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.111">Or if again I set down my shield massive in the middle</p>
	<p id="IL.22.112">and my ponderous helm, and lean my spear up against the rampart</p>
	<p id="IL.22.113">and go out as I am to meet Achilleus the blameless</p>
	<p id="IL.22.114">and promise to give back Helen, and with her all her possessions,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.115">all those things that once in the hollow ships Alexandros</p>
	<p id="IL.22.116">brought back to Troy, and these were the beginning of the quarrel;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.117">to give these to Atreus' sons to take away, and for the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.22.118">also to divide up all that is hidden within the city,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.119">and take an oath thereafter for the Trojans in conclave</p>
	<p id="IL.22.120">not to hide anything away, but distribute all of it,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.121">as much as the lovely citadel keeps guarded within it;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.122">yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?</p>
	<p id="IL.22.123">I might go up to him, and he take no pity upon me</p>
	<p id="IL.22.124">nor respect my position, but kill me naked so, as if I were</p>
	<p id="IL.22.125">a woman, once I stripped my armour from me. There is no</p>
	<p id="IL.22.126">way any more from a tree or a rock to talk to him gently</p>
	<p id="IL.22.127">whispering like a young man and a young girl, in the way</p>
	<p id="IL.22.128">a young man and a young maiden whisper together.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.129">Better to bring on the fight with him as soon as it may be.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.130">We shall see to which one the Olympian grants the glory.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.131">So he pondered, waiting, but Achilleus was closing upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.132">in the likeness of the lord of battles, the helm-shining warrior,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.133">and shaking from above his shoulder the dangerous Pelian</p>
	<p id="IL.22.134">ash spear, while the bronze that closed about him was shining</p>
	<p id="IL.22.135">like the flare of blazing fire or the sun in its rising.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.136">And the shivers took hold of Hektor when he saw him, and he could no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.22.137">stand his ground there, but left the gates behind, and fled, frightened,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.138">and Peleus' son went after him in the confidence of his quick feet.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.139">As when a hawk in the mountains who moves lightest of things flying</p>
	<p id="IL.22.140">makes his effortless swoop for a trembling dove, but she slips away</p>
	<p id="IL.22.141">from beneath and flies and he shrill screaming close after her</p>
	<p id="IL.22.142">plunges for her again and again, heart furious to take her;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.143">so Achilleus went straight for him in fury, but Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.22.144">fled away under the Trojan wall and moved his knees rapidly.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.145">They raced along by the watching point and the windy fig tree</p>
	<p id="IL.22.146">always away from under the wall and along the wagon-way</p>
	<p id="IL.22.147">and came to the two sweet-running well springs. There there are double</p>
	<p id="IL.22.148">springs of water that jet up, the springs of whirling Skamandros.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.149">One of these runs hot water and the steam on all sides</p>
	<p id="IL.22.150">of it rises as if from a fire that was burning inside it.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.151">But the other in the summer-time runs water that is like hail</p>
	<p id="IL.22.152">or chill snow or ice that forms from water. Beside these</p>
	<p id="IL.22.153">in this place, and close to them, are the washing-hollows</p>
	<p id="IL.22.154">of stone, and magnificent, where the wives of the Trojans and their lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.22.155">daughters washed the clothes to shining, in the old days</p>
	<p id="IL.22.156">when there was peace, before the coming of the sons of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.157">They ran beside these, one escaping, the other after him.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.158">It was a great man who fled, but far better he who pursued him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.159">rapidly, since here was no festal beast, no ox-hide</p>
	<p id="IL.22.160">they strove for, for these are prizes that are given men for their running.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.161">No, they ran for the life of Hektor, breaker of horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.162">As when about the turnposts racing single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.22.163">run at full speed, when a great prize is laid up for their winning,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.164">a tripod or a woman, in games for a man's funeral,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.165">so these two swept whirling about the city of Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.22.166">in the speed of their feet, while all the gods were looking upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.167">First to speak among them was the father of gods and mortals:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.168">'Ah me, this is a man beloved whom now my eyes watch</p>
	<p id="IL.22.169">being chased around the wall; my heart is mourning for Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.22.170">who has burned in my honour many thigh pieces of oxen</p>
	<p id="IL.22.171">on the peaks of Ida with all her folds, or again on the uttermost</p>
	<p id="IL.22.172">part of the citadel, but now the brilliant Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.22.173">drives him in speed of his feet around the city of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.174">Come then, you immortals, take thought and take counsel, whether</p>
	<p id="IL.22.175">to rescue this man or whether to make him, for all his valour,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.176">go down under the hands of Achilleus, the son of Peleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.177">Then in answer the goddess grey-eyed Athene spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.178">'Father of the shining bolt, dark misted, what is this you said?</p>
	<p id="IL.22.179">Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since</p>
	<p id="IL.22.180">doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?</p>
	<p id="IL.22.181">Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.182">Then Zeus the gatherer of the clouds spoke to her in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.183">'Tritogeneia, dear daughter, do not lose heart; for I say this</p>
	<p id="IL.22.184">not in outright anger, and my meaning toward you is kindly.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.185">Act as your purpose would have you do, and hold back no longer.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.186">So he spoke, and stirred on Athene, who was eager before this,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.187">and she went in a flash of speed down the pinnacles of Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.188">But swift Achilleus kept unremittingly after Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.189">chasing him, as a dog in the mountains who has flushed from his covert</p>
	<p id="IL.22.190">a deer's fawn follows him through the folding ways and the valleys,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.191">and though the fawn crouched down under a bush and be hidden</p>
	<p id="IL.22.192">he keeps running and noses him out until he comes on him;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.193">so Hektor could not lose himself from swift-footed Peleion.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.194">If ever he made a dash right on for the gates of Dardanos</p>
	<p id="IL.22.195">to get quickly under the strong-built bastions, endeavouring</p>
	<p id="IL.22.196">that they from above with missiles thrown might somehow defend him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.197">each time Achilleus would get in front and force him to turn back</p>
	<p id="IL.22.198">into the plain, and himself kept his flying course next the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.199">As in a dream a man is not able to follow one who runs</p>
	<p id="IL.22.200">from him, nor can the runner escape, nor the other pursue him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.201">so he could not run him down in his speed, nor the other get clear.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.202">How then could Hektor have escaped the death spirits, had not</p>
	<p id="IL.22.203">Apollo, for this last and uttermost time, stood by him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.204">close, and driven strength into him, and made his knees light?</p>
	<p id="IL.22.205">But brilliant Achilleus kept shaking his head at his own people</p>
	<p id="IL.22.206">and would not let them throw their bitter projectiles at Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.22.207">for fear the thrower might win the glory, and himself come second.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.208">But when for the fourth time they had come around to the well springs</p>
	<p id="IL.22.209">then the Father balanced his golden scales, and in them</p>
	<p id="IL.22.210">he set two fateful portions of death, which lays men prostrate,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.211">one for Achilleus, and one for Hektor, breaker of horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.212">and balanced it by the middle; and Hektor's death-day was heavier</p>
	<p id="IL.22.213">and dragged downward toward death, and Phoibos Apollo forsook him.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.214">But the goddess grey-eyed Athene came now to Peleion</p>
	<p id="IL.22.215">and stood close beside him and addressed him in winged words: 'Beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.22.216">of Zeus, shining Achilleus, I am hopeful now that you and I</p>
	<p id="IL.22.217">will take back great glory to the ships of the Achaians, after</p>
	<p id="IL.22.218">we have killed Hektor, for all his slakeless fury for battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.219">Now there is no way for him to get clear away from us,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.220">not though Apollo who strikes from afar should be willing to undergo</p>
	<p id="IL.22.221">much, and wallow before our father Zeus of the aegis.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.222">Stand you here then and get your wind again, while I go</p>
	<p id="IL.22.223">to this man and persuade him to stand up to you in combat.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.224">So spoke Athene, and he was glad at heart, and obeyed her,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.225">and stopped, and stood leaning on his bronze-barbed ash spear. Meanwhile</p>
	<p id="IL.22.226">Athene left him there, and caught up with brilliant Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.227">and likened herself in form and weariless voice to Deïphobos.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.228">She came now and stood close to him and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.229">'Dear brother, indeed swift-footed Achilleus is using you roughly</p>
	<p id="IL.22.230">and chasing you on swift feet around the city of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.231">Come on, then; let us stand fast against him and beat him back from us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.232">Then tall Hektor of the shining helm answered her: 'Deïphobos,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.233">before now you were dearest to me by far of my brothers,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.234">of all those who were sons of Priam and Hekabe, and now</p>
	<p id="IL.22.235">I am minded all the more within my heart to honour you,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.236">you who dared for my sake, when your eyes saw me, to come forth</p>
	<p id="IL.22.237">from the fortifications, while the others stand fast inside them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.238">Then in turn the goddess grey-eyed Athene answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.239">'My brother, it is true our father and the lady our mother, taking</p>
	<p id="IL.22.240">my knees in turn, and my companions about me, entreated</p>
	<p id="IL.22.241">that I stay within, such was the terror upon all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.242">But the heart within me was worn away by hard sorrow for you.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.243">But now let us go straight on and fight hard, let there be no sparing</p>
	<p id="IL.22.244">of our spears, so that we can find out whether Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.22.245">will kill us both and carry our bloody war spoils back</p>
	<p id="IL.22.246">to the hollow ships, or will himself go down under your spear.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.247">So Athene spoke and led him on by beguilement.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.248">Now as the two in their advance were come close together,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.249">first of the two to speak was tall helm-glittering Hektor:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.250">'Son of Peleus, I will no longer run from you, as before this</p>
	<p id="IL.22.251">I fled three times around the great city of Priam, and dared not</p>
	<p id="IL.22.252">stand to your onfall. But now my spirit in turn has driven me</p>
	<p id="IL.22.253">to stand and face you. I must take you now, or I must be taken.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.254">Come then, shall we swear before the gods? For these are the highest</p>
	<p id="IL.22.255">who shall be witnesses and watch over our agreements.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.256">Brutal as you are I will not defile you, if Zeus grants</p>
	<p id="IL.22.257">to me that I can wear you out, and take the life from you.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.258">But after I have stripped your glorious armour, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.259">I will give your corpse back to the Achaians. Do you do likewise.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.260">Then looking darkly at him swift-footed Achilleus answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.261">'Hektor, argue me no agreements. I cannot forgive you.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.262">As there are no trustworthy oaths between men and lions,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.263">nor wolves and lambs have spirit that can be brought to agreement</p>
	<p id="IL.22.264">but forever these hold feelings of hate for each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.265">so there can be no love between you and me, nor shall there be</p>
	<p id="IL.22.266">oaths between us, but one or the other must fall before then</p>
	<p id="IL.22.267">to glut with his blood Ares the god who fights under the shield's guard.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.268">Remember every valour of yours, for now the need comes</p>
	<p id="IL.22.269">hardest upon you to be a spearman and a bold warrior.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.270">There shall be no more escape for you, but Pallas Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.22.271">will kill you soon by my spear. You will pay in a lump for all those</p>
	<p id="IL.22.272">sorrows of my companions you killed in your spear's fury.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.273">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far shadowed, and threw it;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.274">but glorious Hektor kept his eyes on him, and avoided it,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.275">for he dropped, watchful, to his knee, and the bronze spear flew over his shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.22.276">and stuck in the ground, but Pallas Athene snatched it, and gave it</p>
	<p id="IL.22.277">back to Achilleus, unseen by Hektor shepherd of the people.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.278">But now Hektor spoke out to the blameless son of Peleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.279">'You missed; and it was not, o Achilleus like the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.280">from Zeus that you knew my destiny; but you thought so; or rather</p>
	<p id="IL.22.281">you are someone clever in speech and spoke to swindle me,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.282">to make me afraid of you and forget my valour and war strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.283">You will not stick your spear in my back as I run away from you</p>
	<p id="IL.22.284">but drive it into my chest as I storm straight in against you;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.285">if the god gives you that; and now look out for my brazen</p>
	<p id="IL.22.286">spear. I wish it might be taken full length in your body.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.287">And indeed the war would be a lighter thing for the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.22.288">if you were dead, seeing that you are their greatest affliction.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.289">So he spoke, and balanced the spear far shadowed, and threw it,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.290">and struck the middle of Peleïdes' shield, nor missed it,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.291">but the spear was driven far back from the shield, and Hektor was angered</p>
	<p id="IL.22.292">because his swift weapon had been loosed from his hand in a vain cast.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.293">He stood discouraged, and had no other ash spear; but lifting</p>
	<p id="IL.22.294">his voice he called aloud on Deïphobos of the pale shield,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.295">and asked him for a long spear, but Deïphobos was not near him.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.296">And Hektor knew the truth inside his heart, and spoke aloud:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.297">'No use. Here at last the gods have summoned me deathward.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.298">I thought Deïphobos the hero was here close beside me,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.299">but he is behind the wall and it was Athene cheating me,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.300">and now evil death is close to me, and no longer far away,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.301">and there is no way out. So it must long since have been pleasing</p>
	<p id="IL.22.302">to Zeus, and Zeus' son who strikes from afar, this way; though before this</p>
	<p id="IL.22.303">they defended me gladly. But now my death is upon me.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.304">Let me at least not die without a struggle, inglorious,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.305">but do some big thing first, that men to come shall know of it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.306">So he spoke, and pulling out the sharp sword that was slung</p>
	<p id="IL.22.307">at the hollow of his side, huge and heavy, and gathering</p>
	<p id="IL.22.308">himself together, he made his swoop, like a high-flown eagle</p>
	<p id="IL.22.309">who launches himself out of the murk of the clouds on the flat land</p>
	<p id="IL.22.310">to catch away a tender lamb or a shivering hare; so</p>
	<p id="IL.22.311">Hektor made his swoop, swinging his sharp sword, and Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.22.312">charged, the heart within him loaded with savage fury.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.313">In front of his chest the beautiful elaborate great shield</p>
	<p id="IL.22.314">covered him, and with the glittering helm with four horns</p>
	<p id="IL.22.315">he nodded; the lovely golden fringes were shaken about it</p>
	<p id="IL.22.316">which Hephaistos had driven close along the horn of the helmet.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.317">And as a star moves among stars in the night's darkening,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.318">Hesper, who is the fairest star who stands in the sky, such</p>
	<p id="IL.22.319">was the shining from the pointed spear Achilleus was shaking</p>
	<p id="IL.22.320">in his right hand with evil intention toward brilliant Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.321">He was eyeing Hektor's splendid body, to see where it might best</p>
	<p id="IL.22.322">give way, but all the rest of the skin was held in the armour,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.323">brazen and splendid, he stripped when he cut down the strength of Patroklos;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.324">yet showed where the collar-bones hold the neck from the shoulders,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.325">the throat, where death of the soul comes most swiftly; in this place</p>
	<p id="IL.22.326">brilliant Achilleus drove the spear as he came on in fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.327">and clean through the soft part of the neck the spearpoint was driven.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.328">Yet the ash spear heavy with bronze did not sever the windpipe,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.329">so that Hektor could still make exchange of words spoken.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.330">But he dropped in the dust, and brilliant Achilleus vaunted above him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.331">'Hektor, surely you thought as you killed Patroklos you would be</p>
	<p id="IL.22.332">safe, and since I was far away you thought nothing of me,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.333">o fool, for an avenger was left, far greater than he was,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.334">behind him and away by the hollow ships. And it was I;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.335">and I have broken your strength; on you the dogs and the vultures</p>
	<p id="IL.22.336">shall feed and foully rip you; the Achaians will bury Patroklos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.337">In his weakness Hektor of the shining helm spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.338">'I entreat you, by your life, by your knees, by your parents,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.339">do not let the dogs feed on me by the ships of the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.340">but take yourself the bronze and gold that are there in abundance,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.341">those gifts that my father and the lady my mother will give you,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.342">and give my body to be taken home again, so that the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.22.343">and the wives of the Trojans may give me in death my rite of burning.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.344">But looking darkly at him swift-footed Achilleus answered:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.345">'No more entreating of me, you dog, by knees or parents.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.346">I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me</p>
	<p id="IL.22.347">to hack your meat away and eat it raw for the things that</p>
	<p id="IL.22.348">you have done to me. So there is no one who can hold the dogs off</p>
	<p id="IL.22.349">from your head, not if they bring here and set before me ten times</p>
	<p id="IL.22.350">and twenty times the ransom, and promise more in addition,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.351">not if Priam son of Dardanos should offer to weigh out</p>
	<p id="IL.22.352">your bulk in gold; not even so shall the lady your mother</p>
	<p id="IL.22.353">who herself bore you lay you on the death-bed and mourn you:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.354">no, but the dogs and the birds will have you all for their feasting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.355">Then, dying, Hektor of the shining helmet spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.356">'I know you well as I look upon you, I know that I could not</p>
	<p id="IL.22.357">persuade you, since indeed in your breast is a heart of iron.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.358">Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse</p>
	<p id="IL.22.359">upon you, on that day when Paris and Phoibos Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.22.360">destroy you in the Skaian gates, for all your valour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.361">He spoke, and as he spoke the end of death closed in upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.362">and the soul fluttering free of the limbs went down into Death's house</p>
	<p id="IL.22.363">mourning her destiny, leaving youth and manhood behind her.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.364">Now though he was a dead man brilliant Achilleus spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.365">'Die: and I will take my own death at whatever time</p>
	<p id="IL.22.366">Zeus and the rest of the immortals choose to accomplish it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.367">He spoke, and pulled the brazen spear from the body, and laid it</p>
	<p id="IL.22.368">on one side, and stripped away from the shoulders the bloody</p>
	<p id="IL.22.369">armour. And the other sons of the Achaians came running about him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.370">and gazed upon the stature and on the imposing beauty</p>
	<p id="IL.22.371">of Hektor; and none stood beside him who did not stab him;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.372">and thus they would speak one to another, each looking at his neighbour:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.373">'See now, Hektor is much softer to handle than he was</p>
	<p id="IL.22.374">when he set the ships ablaze with the burning firebrand.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.375">So as they stood beside him they would speak, and stab him.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.376">But now, when he had despoiled the body, swift-footed brilliant</p>
	<p id="IL.22.377">Achilleus stood among the Achaians and addressed them in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.378">'Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.379">since the gods have granted me the killing of this man</p>
	<p id="IL.22.380">who has done us much damage, such as not all the others together</p>
	<p id="IL.22.381">have done, come, let us go in armour about the city</p>
	<p id="IL.22.382">to see if we can find out what purpose is in the Trojans,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.383">whether they will abandon their high city, now that this man</p>
	<p id="IL.22.384">has fallen, or are minded to stay, though Hektor lives no longer.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.385">Yet still, why does the heart within me debate on these things?</p>
	<p id="IL.22.386">There is a dead man who lies by the ships, unwept, unburied:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.387">Patroklos: and I will not forget him, never so long as</p>
	<p id="IL.22.388">I remain among the living and my knees have their spring beneath me.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.389">And though the dead forget the dead in the house of Hades,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.390">even there I shall still remember my beloved companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.391">But now, you young men of the Achaians, let us go back, singing</p>
	<p id="IL.22.392">a victory song, to our hollow ships; and take this with us.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.393">We have won ourselves enormous fame; we have killed the great Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.22.394">whom the Trojans glorified as if he were a god in their city.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.395">He spoke, and now thought of shameful treatment for glorious Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.396">In both of his feet at the back he made holes by the tendons</p>
	<p id="IL.22.397">in the space between ankle and heel, and drew thongs of ox-hide through them,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.398">and fastened them to the chariot so as to let the head drag,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.399">and mounted the chariot, and lifted the glorious armour inside it,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.400">then whipped the horses to a run, and they winged their way unreluctant.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.401">A cloud of dust rose where Hektor was dragged, his dark hair was falling</p>
	<p id="IL.22.402">about him, and all that head that was once so handsome was tumbled</p>
	<p id="IL.22.403">in the dust; since by this time Zeus had given him over</p>
	<p id="IL.22.404">to his enemies, to be defiled in the land of his fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.405">So all his head was dragged in the dust; and now his mother</p>
	<p id="IL.22.406">tore out her hair, and threw the shining veil far from her</p>
	<p id="IL.22.407">and raised a great wail as she looked upon her son; and his father</p>
	<p id="IL.22.408">beloved groaned pitifully, and all his people about him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.409">were taken with wailing and lamentation all through the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.410">It was most like what would have happened, if all lowering</p>
	<p id="IL.22.411">Ilion had been burning top to bottom in fire.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.412">His people could scarcely keep the old man in his impatience</p>
	<p id="IL.22.413">from storming out of the Dardanian gates; he implored them</p>
	<p id="IL.22.414">all, and wallowed in the muck before them calling on each man</p>
	<p id="IL.22.415">and naming him by his name: 'Give way, dear friends,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.416">and let me alone though you care for me, leave me to go out</p>
	<p id="IL.22.417">from the city and make my way to the ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.418">I must be suppliant to this man, who is harsh and violent,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.419">and he might have respect for my age and take pity upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.22.420">since I am old, and his father also is old, as I am,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.421">Peleus, who begot and reared him to be an affliction</p>
	<p id="IL.22.422">on the Trojans. He has given us most sorrow, beyond all others,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.423">such is the number of my flowering sons he has cut down.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.424">But for all of these I mourn not so much, in spite of my sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.425">as for one, Hektor, and the sharp grief for him will carry me downward</p>
	<p id="IL.22.426">into Death's house. I wish he had died in my arms, for that way</p>
	<p id="IL.22.427">we two, I myself and his mother who bore him unhappy,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.428">might so have glutted ourselves with weeping for him and mourning.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.429">So he spoke, in tears, and beside him mourned the citizens.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.430">But for the women of Troy Hekabe led out the thronging</p>
	<p id="IL.22.431">chant of sorrow: 'Child, I am wretched. What shall my life be</p>
	<p id="IL.22.432">in my sorrows, now you are dead, who by day and in the night</p>
	<p id="IL.22.433">were my glory in the town, and to all of the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.22.434">and the women of Troy a blessing throughout their city. They adored you</p>
	<p id="IL.22.435">as if you were a god, since in truth you were their high honour</p>
	<p id="IL.22.436">while you lived. Now death and fate have closed in upon you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.437">So she spoke in tears but the wife of Hektor had not yet</p>
	<p id="IL.22.438">heard: for no sure messenger had come to her and told her</p>
	<p id="IL.22.439">how her husband had held his ground there outside the gates;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.440">but she was weaving a web in the inner room of the high house,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.441">a red folding robe, and inworking elaborate figures.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.442">She called out through the house to her lovely-haired handmaidens</p>
	<p id="IL.22.443">to set a great cauldron over the fire, so that there would be</p>
	<p id="IL.22.444">hot water for Hektor's bath as he came back out of the fighting;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.445">poor innocent, nor knew how, far from waters for bathing,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.446">Pallas Athene had cut him down at the hands of Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.447">She heard from the great bastion the noise of mourning and sorrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.448">Her limbs spun, and the shuttle dropped from her hand to the ground. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.22.449">she called aloud to her lovely-haired handmaidens: 'Come here.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.450">Two of you come with me, so I can see what has happened.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.451">I heard the voice of Hektor's honoured mother; within me</p>
	<p id="IL.22.452">my own heart rising beats in my mouth, my limbs under me</p>
	<p id="IL.22.453">are frozen. Surely some evil is near for the children of Priam.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.454">May what I say come never close to my ear; yet dreadfully</p>
	<p id="IL.22.455">I fear that great Achilleus might have cut off bold Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.22.456">alone, away from the city, and be driving him into the flat land,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.457">might put an end to that bitter pride of courage, that always</p>
	<p id="IL.22.458">was on him, since he would never stay back where the men were in numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.22.459">but break far out in front, and give way in his fury to no man.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.460">So she spoke, and ran out of the house like a raving woman</p>
	<p id="IL.22.461">with pulsing heart, and her two handmaidens went along with her.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.462">But when she came to the bastion and where the men were gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.22.463">she stopped, staring, on the wall; and she saw him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.464">being dragged in front of the city, and the running horses</p>
	<p id="IL.22.465">dragged him at random toward the hollow ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.466">The darkness of night misted over the eyes of Andromache.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.467">She fell backward, and gasped the life breath from her, and far off</p>
	<p id="IL.22.468">threw from her head the shining gear that ordered her headdress,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.469">the diadem and the cap, and the holding-band woven together,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.470">and the circlet, which Aphrodite the golden once had given her</p>
	<p id="IL.22.471">on that day when Hektor of the shining helmet led her forth</p>
	<p id="IL.22.472">from the house of Eëtion, and gave numberless gifts to win her.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.473">And about her stood thronging her husband's sisters and the wives of his brothers</p>
	<p id="IL.22.474">and these, in her despair for death, held her up among them.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.475">But she, when she breathed again and the life was gathered back into her,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.476">lifted her voice among the women of Troy in mourning:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.477">'Hektor, I grieve for you. You and I were born to a single</p>
	<p id="IL.22.478">destiny, you in Troy in the house of Priam, and I</p>
	<p id="IL.22.479">in Thebe, underneath the timbered mountain of Plakos</p>
	<p id="IL.22.480">in the house of Eëtion, who cared for me when I was little,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.481">ill-fated he, I ill-starred. I wish he had never begotten me.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.482">Now you go down to the house of Death in the secret places</p>
	<p id="IL.22.483">of the earth, and left me here behind in the sorrow of mourning,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.484">a widow in your house, and the boy is only a baby</p>
	<p id="IL.22.485">who was born to you and me, the unfortunate. You cannot help him,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.486">Hektor, any more, since you are dead. Nor can he help you.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.487">Though he escape the attack of the Achaians with all its sorrows,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.488">yet all his days for your sake there will be hard work for him</p>
	<p id="IL.22.489">and sorrows, for others will take his lands away from him. The day</p>
	<p id="IL.22.490">of bereavement leaves a child with no agemates to befriend him.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.491">He bows his head before every man, his cheeks are bewept, he</p>
	<p id="IL.22.492">goes, needy, a boy among his father's companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.493">and tugs at this man by the mantle, that man by the tunic,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.494">and they pity him, and one gives him a tiny drink from a goblet,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.495">enough to moisten his lips, not enough to moisten his palate.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.496">But one whose parents are living beats him out of the banquet</p>
	<p id="IL.22.497">hitting him with his fists and in words also abuses him:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.498">"Get out, you! Your father is not dining among us."</p>
	<p id="IL.22.499">And the boy goes away in tears to his widowed mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.500">Astyanax, who in days before on the knees of his father</p>
	<p id="IL.22.501">would eat only the marrow or the flesh of sheep that was fattest.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.502">And when sleep would come upon him and he was done with his playing,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.503">he would go to sleep in a bed, in the arms of his nurse, in a soft</p>
	<p id="IL.22.504">bed, with his heart given all its fill of luxury.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.505">Now, with his dear father gone, he has much to suffer:</p>
	<p id="IL.22.506">he, whom the Trojans have called Astyanax, lord of the city,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.507">since it was you alone who defended the gates and the long walls.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.508">But now, beside the curving ships, far away from your parents,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.509">the writhing worms will feed, when the dogs have had enough of you,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.510">on your naked corpse, though in your house there is clothing laid up</p>
	<p id="IL.22.511">that is fine-textured and pleasant, wrought by the hands of women.</p>
	<p id="IL.22.512">But all of these I will burn up in the fire's blazing,</p>
	<p id="IL.22.513">no use to you, since you will never be laid away in them;</p>
	<p id="IL.22.514">but in your honour, from the men of Troy and the Trojan women.'</p>
	<p id="IL.22.515">So she spoke, in tears; and the women joined in her mourning.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.1">So they were mourning through the city. Meanwhile, the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.2">after they had made their way back to their ships and the Hellespont,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.3">scattered, the rest of them, each man to his own ship. Except</p>
	<p id="IL.23.4">Achilleus would not allow the Myrmidons to be scattered,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.5">but called out to his companions whose delight was in battle:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.6">'Myrmidons, you of the fast horses, my steadfast companions,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.7">we must not yet slip free of the chariots our single-foot horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.8">but with these very horses and chariots we must drive close up</p>
	<p id="IL.23.9">to Patroklos and mourn him, since such is the privilege of the perished.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.10">Then, when we have taken full satisfaction from the sorrowful</p>
	<p id="IL.23.11">dirge, we shall set our horses free, and all of us eat here.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.12">He spoke, and all of them assembled moaned, and Achilleus led them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.13">Three times, mourning, they drove their horses with flowing manes about</p>
	<p id="IL.23.14">the body, and among them Thetis stirred the passion for weeping.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.15">The sands were wet, and the armour of men was wet with their tears. Such</p>
	<p id="IL.23.16">was their longing after Patroklos, who drove men to thoughts of terror.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.17">Peleus' son led the thronging chant of their lamentation,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.18">and laid his manslaughtering hands over the chest of his dear friend:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.19">'Good-bye, Patroklos. I hail you even in the house of the death god.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.20">All that I promised you in time past I am accomplishing,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.21">that I would drag Hektor here and give him to the dogs to feed on</p>
	<p id="IL.23.22">raw, and before your burning pyre to behead twelve glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.23.23">children of the Trojans for my anger over your slaying.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.24">He spoke, and thought of shameful treatment for glorious Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.25">He laid him on his face in the dust by the bier of Menoitios'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.26">son. Meanwhile the others took off each man his glittering</p>
	<p id="IL.23.27">brazen armour, and all unyoked their proud neighing horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.28">and sat down in their thousands beside the ship of swift-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.23.29">Aiakides, who set the funeral feast in abundance</p>
	<p id="IL.23.30">before them; and many shining oxen were slaughtered with the stroke</p>
	<p id="IL.23.31">of the iron, and many sheep and bleating goats and numerous</p>
	<p id="IL.23.32">swine with shining teeth and the fat abundant upon them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.33">were singed and stretched out across the flame of Hephaistos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.34">The blood ran and was caught in cups all around the dead man.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.35">But now the kings of the Achaians brought the swift-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.23.36">lord, the son of Peleus, to great Agamemnon, hardly</p>
	<p id="IL.23.37">persuading him, since his heart was still angered for his companion.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.38">When these had made their way to the shelter of Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.23.39">straightway they gave orders to the heralds, the clear crying,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.40">to set a great cauldron over the fire, if so they might persuade</p>
	<p id="IL.23.41">the son of Peleus to wash away the filth of the bloodstains,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.42">but he denied them stubbornly and swore an oath on it:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.43">'No, before Zeus, who is greatest of gods and the highest,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.44">there is no right in letting water come near my head, until</p>
	<p id="IL.23.45">I have laid Patroklos on the burning pyre, and heaped the mound over him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.46">and cut my hair for him, since there will come no second sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.23.47">like this to my heart again while I am still one of the living.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.48">Then let us now give way to the gloomy feast; and with the dawn</p>
	<p id="IL.23.49">cause your people to rise, o lord of men Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.50">and bring in timber and lay it by, with all that is fitting</p>
	<p id="IL.23.51">for the dead man to have when he goes down under the gloom and the darkness,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.52">so that with the more speed the unwearying fire may burn him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.53">away from our eyes, and the people turn back to that which they must do.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.54">So he spoke, and they listened well to him and obeyed him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.55">and in speed and haste they got the dinner ready, and each man</p>
	<p id="IL.23.56">feasted, nor was any men's hunger denied a fair portion.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.57">But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.58">they went away to sleep, each man into his own shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.59">but along the beach of the thunderous sea the son of Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.60">lay down, groaning heavily, among the Myrmidon numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.61">in a clear place where the waves washed over the beach; and at that time</p>
	<p id="IL.23.62">sleep caught him and was drifted sweetly about him, washing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.63">the sorrows out of his mind, for his shining limbs were grown weary</p>
	<p id="IL.23.64">indeed, from running in chase of Hektor toward windy Ilion;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.65">and there appeared to him the ghost of unhappy Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.66">all in his likeness for stature, and the lovely eyes, and voice,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.67">and wore such clothing as Patroklos had worn on his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.68">The ghost came and stood over his head and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.69">'You sleep, Achilleus; you have forgotten me; but you were not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.70">careless of me when I lived, but only in death. Bury me</p>
	<p id="IL.23.71">as quickly as may be, let me pass through the gates of Hades.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.72">The souls, the images of dead men, hold me at a distance,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.73">and will not let me cross the river and mingle among them,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.74">but I wander as I am by Hades' house of the wide gates.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.75">And I call upon you in sorrow, give me your hand; no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.23.76">shall I come back from death, once you give me my rite of burning.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.77">No longer shall you and I, alive, sit apart from our other</p>
	<p id="IL.23.78">beloved companions and make our plans, since the bitter destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.23.79">that was given me when I was born has opened its jaws to take me.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.80">And you, Achilleus like the gods, have your own destiny;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.81">to be killed under the wall of the prospering Trojans. There is one</p>
	<p id="IL.23.82">more thing I will say, and ask of you, if you will obey me:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.83">do not have my bones laid apart from yours, Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.84">but with them, just as we grew up together in your house,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.85">when Menoitios brought me there from Opous, when I was little,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.86">and into your house, by reason of a baneful manslaying,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.87">on that day when I killed the son of Amphidamas. I was</p>
	<p id="IL.23.88">a child only, nor intended it, but was angered over a dice game.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.89">There the rider Peleus took me into his own house,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.90">and brought me carefully up, and named me to be your henchman.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.91">Therefore, let one single vessel, the golden two-handled</p>
	<p id="IL.23.92">urn the lady your mother gave you, hold both our ashes.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.93">Then in answer to him spoke swift-footed Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.94">'How is it, o hallowed head of my brother, you have come back to me</p>
	<p id="IL.23.95">here, and tell me all these several things? Yet surely</p>
	<p id="IL.23.96">I am accomplishing all, and I shall do as you tell me.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.97">But stand closer to me, and let us, if only for a little,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.98">embrace, and take full satisfaction from the dirge of sorrow.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.99">So he spoke, and with his own arms reached for him, but could not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.100">take him, but the spirit went underground, like vapour,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.101">with a thin cry, and Achilleus started awake, staring,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.102">and drove his hands together, and spoke, and his words were sorrowful:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.103">'Oh, wonder! Even in the house of Hades there is left something,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.104">a soul and an image, but there is no real heart of life in it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.105">For all night long the phantom of unhappy Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.106">stood over me in lamentation and mourning, and the likeness</p>
	<p id="IL.23.107">to him was wonderful, and it told me each thing I should do.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.108">So he spoke, and stirred in all of them the passion of mourning,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.109">and Dawn of the rose fingers showed on them as still they mourned</p>
	<p id="IL.23.110">about the forlorn body. Now powerful Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.23.111">gave order for men and mules to assemble from all the shelters</p>
	<p id="IL.23.112">and bring in timber, and a great man led them in motion,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.113">Meriones, the henchman of courtly Idomeneus. These then</p>
	<p id="IL.23.114">went out and in their hands carried axes to cut wood</p>
	<p id="IL.23.115">and ropes firmly woven, and their mules went on ahead of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.116">They went many ways, uphill, downhill, sidehill and slantwise;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.117">but when they came to the spurs of Ida with all her well springs,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.118">they set to hewing with the thin edge of bronze and leaning</p>
	<p id="IL.23.119">their weight to the strokes on towering-leafed oak trees that toppled</p>
	<p id="IL.23.120">with huge crashing; then the Achaians splitting the timbers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.121">fastened them to the mules and these with their feet tore up</p>
	<p id="IL.23.122">the ground as they pulled through the dense undergrowth to the flat land.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.123">All the woodcutters carried logs themselves; such was the order</p>
	<p id="IL.23.124">of Meriones, the henchman of courtly Idomeneus. These then</p>
	<p id="IL.23.125">threw down their burdens in order along the beach, where Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.126">had chosen place for a huge grave mound, for himself and Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.127">Then when on all sides they had thrown down abundance of timber,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.128">they sat down where they were, assembled. And now Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.129">gave order at once to the Myrmidons, whose delight was in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.130">to belt themselves in bronze and each man to yoke his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.131">to the chariot. And they rose up and got into their armour</p>
	<p id="IL.23.132">and stepped up, charioteer and sideman, into the chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.23.133">with the horsemen in front, and behind them came on a cloud of foot-soldiers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.134">by thousands; and in the midst his companions carried Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.135">They covered all the corpse under the locks of their hair, which they cut off</p>
	<p id="IL.23.136">and dropped on him, and behind them brilliant Achilleus held the head</p>
	<p id="IL.23.137">sorrowing, for this was his true friend he escorted toward Hades.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.138">When these had come to the place Achilleus had spoken of to them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.139">they laid him down, and quickly piled up abundant timber.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.140">And now brilliant swift-footed Achilleus remembered one more thing.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.141">He stood apart from the pyre and cut off a lock of fair hair</p>
	<p id="IL.23.142">which he had grown long to give to the river Spercheios, and gazing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.143">in deep distress out over the wine-blue water, he spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.144">'Spercheios, it was in vain that Peleus my father vowed to you</p>
	<p id="IL.23.145">that there, when I had won home to the beloved land of my fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.146">I would cut my hair for you and make you a grand and holy</p>
	<p id="IL.23.147">sacrifice of fifty rams consecrate to the waters</p>
	<p id="IL.23.148">of your springs, where is your holy ground and your smoking altar.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.149">So the old man vowed, but you did not accomplish his purpose.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.150">Now, since I do not return to the beloved land of my fathers,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.151">I would give my hair into the keeping of the hero Patroklos.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.152">He spoke, and laid his hair in the hands of his beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.23.153">companion, and stirred in all of them the passion of mourning.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.154">And now the light of the sum would have set on their lamentation</p>
	<p id="IL.23.155">had not Achilleus soon stood by Agamemnon and spoken:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.156">'Son of Atreus, beyond others the people of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.23.157">will obey your words. There can be enough, even in mourning.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.158">Now cause them to scatter from the fire and bid them make ready</p>
	<p id="IL.23.159">their dinner; and we, who are most nearly concerned with the dead man,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.160">shall do this work; except only let the leaders stay near us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.161">Then the lord of men, Agamemnon, when he had heard this,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.162">at once caused the people to disperse among the balanced ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.163">but the close mourners stayed by the place and piled up the timber,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.164">and built a pyre a hundred feet long this way and that way,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.165">and on the peak of the pyre they laid the body, sorrowful</p>
	<p id="IL.23.166">at heart; and in front of it skinned and set in order numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.167">of fat sheep and shambling horn-curved cattle; and from all</p>
	<p id="IL.23.168">great-hearted Achilleus took the fat and wrapped the corpse in it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.169">from head to foot, and piled up the skinned bodies about it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.170">Then he set beside him two-handled jars of oil and honey</p>
	<p id="IL.23.171">leaning them against the bier, and drove four horses with strong necks</p>
	<p id="IL.23.172">swiftly aloft the pyre with loud lamentation. And there were</p>
	<p id="IL.23.173">nine dogs of the table that had belonged to the lord Patroklos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.174">Of these he cut the throats of two, and set them on the pyre;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.175">and so also killed twelve noble sons of the great-hearted Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.23.176">with the stroke of bronze, and evil were the thoughts in his heart against them,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.177">and let loose the iron fury of the fire to feed on them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.178">Then he groaned, and called by name on his beloved companion:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.179">'Good-bye, Patroklos. I hail you even in the house of the death god</p>
	<p id="IL.23.180">For all that I promised you in time past I am accomplishing.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.181">Here are twelve noble sons of the great-hearted Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.23.182">whom the fire feeds on, all, as it feeds on you. But I will not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.183">give Hektor, Priam's son, to the fire, but the dogs, to feast on.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.184">So he spoke his threat. But the dogs did not deal with Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.185">for Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, drove the dogs back from him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.186">by day and night, and anointed him with rosy immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.23.187">oil, so Achilleus, when he dragged him about, might not tear him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.188">And Phoibos Apollo brought down a darkening mist about him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.189">from the sky to the plain, and covered with it all the space that was taken</p>
	<p id="IL.23.190">by the dead man, to keep the force of the sum from coming</p>
	<p id="IL.23.191">first, and wither his body away by limbs and sinews.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.192">But the pyre of dead Patroklos would not light. Then swift-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.23.193">brilliant Achilleus thought of one more thing that he must do.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.194">He stood apart from the pyre and made his prayer to the two winds</p>
	<p id="IL.23.195">Boreas and Zephyros, north wind and west, and promised them splendid</p>
	<p id="IL.23.196">offerings, and much outpouring from a golden goblet entreated them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.197">to come, so that the bodies might with best speed burn in the fire</p>
	<p id="IL.23.198">and the timber burst into flame. And Iris, hearing his prayer,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.199">went swiftly as messenger to the winds for him. Now the winds</p>
	<p id="IL.23.200">assembled within the house of storm-blowing Zephyros</p>
	<p id="IL.23.201">were taking part in a feast, and Iris paused in her running</p>
	<p id="IL.23.202">and stood on the stone doorsill; but they, when their eyes saw her,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.203">sprang to their feet, and each one asked her to sit beside him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.204">But she refused to be seated and spoke her word to them: 'I must not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.205">sit down. I am going back to the running waters of Ocean</p>
	<p id="IL.23.206">and the Aithiopians' land, where they are making grand sacrifice</p>
	<p id="IL.23.207">to the immortals; there I, too, shall partake of the sacraments.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.208">But Achilleus' prayer is that Boreas and blustering Zephyros</p>
	<p id="IL.23.209">may come to him, and he promises them splendid offerings,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.210">so that you may set ablaze the funeral pyre, whereon lies</p>
	<p id="IL.23.211">Patroklos, with all Achaians mourning about him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.212">She spoke so, and went away, and they with immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.23.213">clamour rose up, and swept the clouds in confusion before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.214">They came with a sudden blast upon the sea, and the waves rose</p>
	<p id="IL.23.215">under the whistling wind. They came to the generous Troad</p>
	<p id="IL.23.216">and hit the pyre, and a huge inhuman blaze rose, roaring.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.217">Nightlong they piled the flames on the funeral pyre together</p>
	<p id="IL.23.218">and blew with a screaming blast, and nightlong swift-footed Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.219">from a golden mixing-bowl, with a two-handled goblet in his hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.220">drew the wine and poured it on the ground and drenched the ground with it,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.221">and called upon the soul of unhappy Patroklos. And as</p>
	<p id="IL.23.222">a father mourns as he burns the bones of a son, who was married</p>
	<p id="IL.23.223">only now, and died to grieve his unhappy parents,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.224">so Achilleus was mourning as he burned his companion's</p>
	<p id="IL.23.225">bones, and dragged himself by the fire in close lamentation.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.226">At that time when the dawn star passes across earth, harbinger</p>
	<p id="IL.23.227">of light, and after him dawn of the saffron mantle is scattered</p>
	<p id="IL.23.228">across the sea, the fire died down and the flames were over.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.229">The winds took their way back toward home again, crossing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.230">the Thracian water, and it boiled with a moaning swell as they crossed it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.231">The son of Peleus turned aside and away from the burning</p>
	<p id="IL.23.232">and lay down exhausted, and sweet sleep rose upon him. But now</p>
	<p id="IL.23.233">they who were with the son of Atreus assembled together</p>
	<p id="IL.23.234">and the sound and murmur of their oncoming wakened Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.235">who straightened himself and sat upright and spoke a word to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.236">'Son of Atreus, and you other greatest of all the Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.237">first put out with gleaming wine the pyre that is burning,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.238">all that still has on it the fury of fire; and afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.23.239">we shall gather up the bones of Patroklos, the son of Menoitios,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.240">which we shall easily tell apart, since they are conspicuous</p>
	<p id="IL.23.241">where he lay in the middle of the pyre and the others far from him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.242">at the edge burned, the men indiscriminately with the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.243">And let us lay his bones in a golden jar and a double</p>
	<p id="IL.23.244">fold of fat, until I myself enfold him in Hades.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.245">And I would have you build a grave mound which is not very great</p>
	<p id="IL.23.246">but such as will be fitting, for now; afterwards, the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.23.247">can make it broad and high--such of you Achaians as may be</p>
	<p id="IL.23.248">left to survive me here by the benched ships, after I am gone.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.249">So he spoke, and they did as swift-footed Peleion told them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.250">First with gleaming wine they put out the pyre that was burning,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.251">as much as was still aflame, and the ashes dropped deep from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.252">Then they gathered up the white bones of their gentle companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.253">weeping, and put them into a golden jar with a double</p>
	<p id="IL.23.254">fold of fat, and laid it away in his shelter, and covered it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.255">with a thin veil; then laid out the tomb and cast down the holding walls</p>
	<p id="IL.23.256">around the funeral pyre, then heaped the loose earth over them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.257">and piled the tomb, and turned to go away. But Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.258">held the people there, and made them sit down in a wide assembly,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.259">and brought prizes for games out of his ships, cauldrons and tripods,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.260">and horses and mules and the powerful high heads of cattle</p>
	<p id="IL.23.261">and fair-girdled women and grey iron. First of all</p>
	<p id="IL.23.262">he set forth the glorious prizes for speed of foot for the horsemen;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.263">a woman faultless in the work of her hands to lead away</p>
	<p id="IL.23.264">and a tripod with ears and holding twenty-two measures</p>
	<p id="IL.23.265">for the first prize; and for the second he set forth a six-year-old</p>
	<p id="IL.23.266">unbroken mare who carried a mule foal within her.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.267">Then for the third prize he set forth a splendid unfired</p>
	<p id="IL.23.268">cauldron, which held four measures, with its natural gloss still upon it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.269">For the fourth place he set out two talents' weight of gold, and for</p>
	<p id="IL.23.270">the fifth place set forth an unfired jar with two handles.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.271">He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.272">'Son of Atreus and all you other strong-greaved Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.273">these prizes are in the place of games and wait for the horsemen.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.274">Now if we Achaians were contending for the sake of some other</p>
	<p id="IL.23.275">hero, I myself should take the first prize away to my shelter.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.276">You know how much my horses surpass in their speed all others;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.277">yes, for they are immortal horses, and Poseidon gave them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.278">to Peleus my father, who in turn gave them into my hands.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.279">But I stay here at the side, and my single-foot horses stay with me;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.280">such is the high glory of the charioteer they have lost,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.281">the gentle one, who so many times anointed their manes with</p>
	<p id="IL.23.282">soft olive oil, after he had washed them in shining water.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.283">Therefore these two horses stand here and grieve, and their manes</p>
	<p id="IL.23.284">are swept along the ground as they stand with hearts full of sorrow.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.285">But take, the rest of you, places in the field, whichever Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.23.286">has confidence in his horses and his compacted chariot.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.287">So spoke the son of Peleus, and the swift riders gathered.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.288">Far the first to rise up was the lord of men Eumelos,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.289">own son of Admetos, who surpassed in horsemanship. After</p>
	<p id="IL.23.290">him rose up the son of Tydeus, strong Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.291">and led under the yoke the Trojan horses whom he had taken</p>
	<p id="IL.23.292">by force from Aineias, but Aineias himself was saved by Apollo.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.293">After him rose the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.294">the sky-descended, and led beneath the yoke the swift horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.295">Aithe, Agamemnon's mare, and his own Podargos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.296">Echepolos, son of Anchises, gave her to Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.23.297">as a gift, so as not to have to go with him to windy Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.23.298">but stay where he was and enjoy himself, since Zeus had given him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.299">great wealth, and he made his home in the wide spaces of Sikyon.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.300">This mare, who was straining hard for the race, Menelaos harnessed.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.301">Fourth to order his horses with flowing manes was Antilochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.302">the glorious son of Nestor, Neleus' son, the high-hearted</p>
	<p id="IL.23.303">lord, and fast-running horses out of the breed of Pylos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.304">pulled his chariot, and his father standing close beside him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.305">gave well-intentioned advice to his own good understanding:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.306">'Antilochos, you are young indeed, but Zeus and Poseidon</p>
	<p id="IL.23.307">have loved you and taught you horsemanship in all of its aspects.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.308">Therefore there is no great need to instruct you; you yourself</p>
	<p id="IL.23.309">know well how to double the turning-post. Yet in this race your horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.310">should run slowest. Therefore I think your work will be heavy.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.311">The horses of these men are faster, but they themselves do not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.312">understand any more than you of the science of racing.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.313">Remember then, dear son, to have your mind full of every</p>
	<p id="IL.23.314">resource of skill, so that the prizes may not elude you.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.315">The woodcutter is far better for skill than he is for brute strength.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.316">It is by skill that the sea captain holds his rapid ship</p>
	<p id="IL.23.317">on its course, though torn by winds, over the wine-blue water.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.318">By skill charioteer outpasses charioteer. He</p>
	<p id="IL.23.319">who has put all his confidence in his horses and chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.23.320">and recklessly makes a turn that is loose one way or another</p>
	<p id="IL.23.321">finds his horses drifting out of the course and does not control them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.322">But the man, though he drive the slower horses, who takes his advantage,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.323">keeps his eye always on the post and turns tight, ever watchful,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.324">pulled with the ox-hide reins on the course, as in the beginning,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.325">and holds his horses steady in hand, and watches the leader.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.326">I will give you a clear mark and you cannot fail to notice it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.327">There is a dry stump standing up from the ground about six feet,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.328">oak, it may be, or pine, and not rotted away by rain-water,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.329">and two white stones are leaned against it, one on either side,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.330">at the joining place of the ways, and there is smooth driving around it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.331">Either it is the grave-mark of someone who died long ago,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.332">or was set as a racing goal by men who lived before our time.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.333">Now swift-footed brilliant Achilleus has made it the turning-post.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.334">You must drive your chariot and horses so as to hug this,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.335">and yourself, in the strong-fabricated chariot, lean over</p>
	<p id="IL.23.336">a little to the left of the course, and as for your right horse, whip him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.337">and urge him along, slackening your hands to give him his full rein,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.338">but make your left-hand horse keep hard against the turning-post</p>
	<p id="IL.23.339">so that the hub's edge of your fashioned wheel will seem to be</p>
	<p id="IL.23.340">touching it, yet take care not really to brush against it,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.341">for, if so, you might damage your horses and break your chariot,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.342">and that will be a thing of joy for the others, and a failure</p>
	<p id="IL.23.343">for you. So, dear son, drive thoughtfully and be watchful.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.344">For if you follow the others but get first by the turning-post,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.345">there is none who could sprint to make it up, nor close you, nor pass you,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.346">not if the man behind you were driving the great Arion,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.347">the swift horse of Adrestos, whose birth is from the immortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.348">or Laomedon's horses, who were the pride of those raised in this country.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.349">So spoke Nestor the son of Neleus, and turned back to his place</p>
	<p id="IL.23.350">and sat down, having talked to his son of each stage in the contest.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.351">Fifth to order his horses with flowing manes was Meriones.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.352">They climbed to the chariots and deposited the lots. Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.353">shook them, and the first to fall out was that of Antilochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.354">Nestor's son, and strong Eumelos drew next after him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.355">and after him the son of Atreus, Menelaos the spear-famed.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.356">Meriones drew the next lane to drive, and the last for the driving</p>
	<p id="IL.23.357">of horses was drawn by far the best of them all, Diomedes.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.358">They stood in line for the start, and Achilleus showed them the turn-post</p>
	<p id="IL.23.359">far away on the level plain, and beside it he stationed</p>
	<p id="IL.23.360">a judge, Phoinix the godlike, the follower of his father,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.361">to mark and remember the running and bring back a true story.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.362">Then all held their whips high-lifted above their horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.363">then struck with the whip thongs and in words urged their horses onward</p>
	<p id="IL.23.364">into speed. Rapidly they made their way over the flat land</p>
	<p id="IL.23.365">and presently were far away from the ships. The dust lifting</p>
	<p id="IL.23.366">clung beneath the horses' chests like cloud or a stormwhirl.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.367">Their manes streamed along the blast of the wind, the chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.23.368">rocking now would dip to the earth who fosters so many</p>
	<p id="IL.23.369">and now again would spring up clear of the ground, and the drivers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.370">stood in the chariots, with the spirit beating in each man</p>
	<p id="IL.23.371">with the strain to win, and each was calling aloud upon his own</p>
	<p id="IL.23.372">horses, and the horses flew through the dust of the flat land.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.373">But as the rapid horses were running the last of the race-course</p>
	<p id="IL.23.374">back, and toward the grey sea, then the mettle of each began to</p>
	<p id="IL.23.375">show itself, and the field of horses strung out, and before long</p>
	<p id="IL.23.376">out in front was the swift-stepping team of the son of Pheres,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.377">Eumelos, and after him the stallions of Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.378">the Trojan horses, not far behind at all, but close on him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.379">for they seemed forever on the point of climbing his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.23.380">and the wind of them was hot on the back and on the broad shoulders</p>
	<p id="IL.23.381">of Eumelos. They lowered their heads and flew close after him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.382">And now he might have passed him or run to a doubtful decision,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.383">had not Phoibos Apollo been angry with Diomedes,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.384">Tydeus' son, and dashed the shining whip from his hands, so</p>
	<p id="IL.23.385">that the tears began to stream from his eyes, for his anger</p>
	<p id="IL.23.386">as he watched how the mares of Eumelos drew far ahead of him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.387">while his own horses ran without the whip and were slowed. Yet</p>
	<p id="IL.23.388">Athene did not fail to see the foul play of Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.23.389">on Tydeus' son. She swept in speed to the shepherd of the people</p>
	<p id="IL.23.390">and gave him back his whip, and inspired strength into his horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.391">Then in her wrath she went on after the son of Admetos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.392">and she, a goddess, smashed his chariot yoke, and his horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.393">ran on either side of the way, the pole dragged, and Eumelos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.394">himself was sent spinning out beside the wheel of the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.23.395">so that his elbows were all torn, and his mouth, and his nostrils,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.396">and his forehead was lacerated about the brows, and his eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.23.397">filled with tears, and the springing voice was held fast within him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.398">Then the son of Tydeus, turning his single-foot horses to pass him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.399">went far out in front of the others, seeing that Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.23.400">had inspired strength in his horses and to himself gave the glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.401">After him came the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.402">But Antilochos cried out aloud to his father's horses:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.403">'Come on, you two. Pull, as fast as you can! I am not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.404">trying to make you match your speed with the speed of those others,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.405">the horses of Tydeus' valiant son, to whom now Athene</p>
	<p id="IL.23.406">has granted speed and to their rider has given the glory.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.407">But make your burst to catch the horses of the son of Atreus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.408">nor let them leave you behind, for fear Aithe who is female</p>
	<p id="IL.23.409">may shower you in mockery. Are you falling back, my brave horses?</p>
	<p id="IL.23.410">For I will tell you this, and it will be a thing accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.411">There will be no more care for you from the shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.412">Nestor, but he will slaughter you out of hand with the edge</p>
	<p id="IL.23.413">of bronze, if we win the meaner prize because you are unwilling.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.414">Keep on close after him and make all the speed you are able.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.415">I myself shall know what to do and contrive it, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.23.416">we get by in the narrow place of the way. He will not escape me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.417">So he spoke, and they fearing the angry voice of their master</p>
	<p id="IL.23.418">ran harder for a little while, and presently after this</p>
	<p id="IL.23.419">battle-stubborn Antilochos saw where the hollow way narrowed.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.420">There was a break in the ground where winter water had gathered</p>
	<p id="IL.23.421">and broken out of the road, and made a sunken place all about.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.422">Menelaos shrinking from a collision of chariots steered there,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.423">but Antilochos also turned out his single-foot horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.424">from the road, and bore a little way aside, and went after him;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.425">and the son of Atreus was frightened and called out aloud to Antilochos:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.426">'Antilochos, this is reckless horsemanship. Hold in your horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.427">The way is narrow here, it will soon be wider for passing.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.428">Be careful not to crash your chariot and wreck both of us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.429">So he spoke, but Antilochos drove on all the harder</p>
	<p id="IL.23.430">with a whiplash for greater speed, as if he had never heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.431">As far as is the range of a discus swung from the shoulder</p>
	<p id="IL.23.432">and thrown by a stripling who tries out the strength of his young manhood,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.433">so far they ran even, but then the mares of Atreides gave way</p>
	<p id="IL.23.434">and fell back, for he of his own will slackened his driving</p>
	<p id="IL.23.435">for fear that in the road the single-foot horses might crash</p>
	<p id="IL.23.436">and overturn the strong-fabricated chariots, and the men</p>
	<p id="IL.23.437">themselves go down in the dust through their hard striving for victory.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.438">But Menelaos of the fair hair called to him in anger:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.439">'Antilochos, there is no other man more cursed than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.440">Damn you. We Achaians lied when we said you had good sense.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.441">Even so, you will not get this prize without having to take oath.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.442">He spoke, and lifted his voice and called aloud to his horses:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.443">'Never hold back now, never stop, for all your hearts are</p>
	<p id="IL.23.444">sorrowful. The feet of these and their knees will weary</p>
	<p id="IL.23.445">before yours do, seeing that the youth is gone from those horses.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.446">So he spoke, and they fearing the angry voice of their master</p>
	<p id="IL.23.447">ran the harder, and soon were close up behind the others.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.448">Now the Argives who sat in their assembly were watching</p>
	<p id="IL.23.449">the horses, and the horses flew through the dust of the flat land.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.450">Idomeneus, lord of the Kretans, was first to make out the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.451">for he sat apart from the others assembled, and higher up, where</p>
	<p id="IL.23.452">he could see all ways, and from far off he heard Diomedes</p>
	<p id="IL.23.453">calling, and knew him, and made out one horse ahead of the others</p>
	<p id="IL.23.454">who was conspicuous, all red, except on his forehead</p>
	<p id="IL.23.455">there was a white mark, round, like the full moon. Idomeneus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.456">rose to his feet upright and spoke his word out to the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.457">'Friends, who are leaders of the Argives and keep their counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.458">am I the only one who can see the horses, or can you</p>
	<p id="IL.23.459">also? It seems to me there are other horses leading</p>
	<p id="IL.23.460">and I make out another charioteer. The mares of Eumelos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.461">must have come to grief somewhere in the plain, who led on the way out,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.462">for those I saw running out in front as they made the turn-post</p>
	<p id="IL.23.463">I can see no longer anywhere, though I watch and though my eyes</p>
	<p id="IL.23.464">look everywhere about the plain of Troy. But it must be</p>
	<p id="IL.23.465">that the reins got away from the charioteer, or he could not hold them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.466">well in hand at the goal and failed to double the turn-post.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.467">There I think he must have been thrown out and his chariot broken,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.468">and the mares bolted away with the wildness upon their spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.469">But you also stand up and look for yourselves; I cannot</p>
	<p id="IL.23.470">well make out, but it seems to me the man who is leading</p>
	<p id="IL.23.471">is an Aitolian by birth, but lord of the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.472">the son of Tydeus, breaker of horses, strong Diomedes.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.473">Swift Aias, son of Oïleus, spoke shamefully to him in anger:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.474">'Idomeneus, what was all this windy talk? The light-footed</p>
	<p id="IL.23.475">horses are still far where they sweep over the great plain.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.476">You are not by so much the youngest among the Argives,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.477">nor do the eyes in your head see so much sharper than others.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.478">But forever you are windy with your words, and you should not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.479">be a windy speaker. There are others here better than you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.480">The horses who are in front are the same as before, and they are</p>
	<p id="IL.23.481">those of Eumelos, and he stands holding the reins behind them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.482">The lord of the Kretans answered him to his face in anger:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.483">'Aias, surpassing in abuse, yet stupid, in all else</p>
	<p id="IL.23.484">you are worst of the Argives with that stubborn mind of yours. Come then,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.485">let us put up a wager of a tripod or cauldron</p>
	<p id="IL.23.486">and make Agamemnon, son of Atreus, witness between us</p>
	<p id="IL.23.487">as to which horses lead. And when you pay, you will find out.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.488">So he spoke, and swift Aias, son of Oïleus, was rising</p>
	<p id="IL.23.489">up, angry in turn, to trade hard words with him. And now</p>
	<p id="IL.23.490">the quarrel between the two of them would have gone still further,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.491">had not Achilleus himself risen up and spoken between them:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.492">'No longer now, Aias and Idomeneus, continue</p>
	<p id="IL.23.493">to exchange this bitter and evil talk. It is not becoming.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.494">If another acted so, you yourselves would be angry.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.495">Rather sit down again among those assembled and watch for</p>
	<p id="IL.23.496">the horses, and they in their strain for victory will before long</p>
	<p id="IL.23.497">be here. Then you each can see for himself, and learn which</p>
	<p id="IL.23.498">of the Argives horses have run first and which have run second.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.499">He spoke, and now Tydeus' son in his rapid course was close on them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.500">and he lashed them always with the whipstroke from the shoulder. His horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.501">still lifted their feet light and high as they made their swift passage.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.502">Dust flying splashed always the charioteer, and the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.23.503">that was overlaid with gold and tin still rolled hard after</p>
	<p id="IL.23.504">the flying feet of the horses, and in their wake there was not much</p>
	<p id="IL.23.505">trace from the running rims of the wheels left in the thin dust.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.506">The horses came in running hard. Diomedes stopped them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.507">in the middle of where the men were assembled, with the dense sweat starting</p>
	<p id="IL.23.508">and dripping to the ground from neck and chest of his horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.509">He himself vaulted down to the ground from his shining chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.23.510">and leaned his whip against the yoke. Nor did strong Sthenelos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.511">delay, but made haste to take up the prizes, and gave the woman</p>
	<p id="IL.23.512">to his high-hearted companions to lead away and the tripod</p>
	<p id="IL.23.513">with ears to carry, while Diomedes set free the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.514">After him Neleian Antilochos drove in his horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.515">having passed Menelaos, not by speed but by taking advantage.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.516">But even so Menelaos held his fast horses close on him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.517">As far as from the wheel stands the horse who is straining</p>
	<p id="IL.23.518">to pull his master with the chariot over the flat land;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.519">the extreme hairs in the tail of the horse brush against the running</p>
	<p id="IL.23.520">rim of the wheel, and he courses very close, there is not much</p>
	<p id="IL.23.521">space between as he runs a great way over the flat land;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.522">by so much Menelaos was left behind by Antilochos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.523">the blameless. At first he was left behind the length of a discus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.524">thrown, but was overhauling him fast, with Aithe</p>
	<p id="IL.23.525">of the fair mane, Agamemnon's mare, putting on a strong burst.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.526">If both of them had had to run the course any further,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.527">Menelaos would have passed him, and there could have been no argumen</p>
	<p id="IL.23.528">But Meriones, strong henchman of Idomeneus, was left</p>
	<p id="IL.23.529">a spearcast's length behind by glorious Menelaos.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.530">For his horses with splendid manes were slowest of all, and likewise</p>
	<p id="IL.23.531">he himself was of least account for the racing of chariots.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.532">Last and behind them all came in the son of Admetos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.533">dragging his fine chariot and driving his horses before him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.534">and seeing this, brilliant swift-footed Achilleus took pity upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.535">and stood forth among the Argives and spoke to them all in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.536">'The best man is driving his single-foot horses in last.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.537">Come then, we must give some kind of prize, and well he deserves it;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.538">second prize; let first place go to the son of Tydeus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.539">So he spoke, and all gave approval to what he was urging,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.540">and he would have given him the horse, since all the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.23.541">approved, had not Antilochos, son of great-hearted Nestor,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.542">stood up to answer Peleid Achilleus, and argue:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.543">'Achilleus, I shall be very angry with you if you accomplish</p>
	<p id="IL.23.544">what you have said. You mean to take my prize away from me,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.545">with the thought in mind that his chariot fouled and his running horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.546">but he himself is great. He should have prayed to the immortal</p>
	<p id="IL.23.547">gods. That is why he came in last of all in the running.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.548">But if you are sorry for him and he is dear to your liking,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.549">there is abundant gold in your shelter, and there is bronze there</p>
	<p id="IL.23.550">and animals, and there are handmaidens and single-foot horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.551">You can take from these, and give him afterwards a prize still greater</p>
	<p id="IL.23.552">than mine, or now at once, and have the Achaians applaud you.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.553">But the mare I will not give up, and the man who wants her</p>
	<p id="IL.23.554">must fight me for her with his hands before he can take her.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.555">So he spoke, but brilliant swift-footed Achilleus, favouring</p>
	<p id="IL.23.556">Antilochos, smiled, since he was his beloved companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.557">and answered him and addressed him in winged words: 'Antilochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.558">if you would have me bring some other thing out of my dwelling</p>
	<p id="IL.23.559">as special gift for Eumelos, then for your sake I will do it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.560">I will give him that corselet I stripped from Asteropaios;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.561">it is bronze, but there is an overlay circled about it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.562">in shining tin. It will be a gift that will mean much to him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.563">He spoke, and told Automedon, his beloved companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.564">to bring it out of the shelter, and he went away, and brought it back,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.565">and put it in Eumelos' hands. And he accepted it joyfully.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.566">But now Menelaos, heart full of bitterness, stood up among them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.567">in relentless anger against Antilochos, and the herald</p>
	<p id="IL.23.568">put the staff into his hand and gave the call for the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.23.569">to be silent. And he stood forth, a man like a god, and spoke to them:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.570">'Antilochos, you had good sense once. See what you have done.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.571">You have defiled my horsemanship, you have fouled my horses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.572">by throwing your horses in their way, though yours were far slower.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.573">Come then, o leaders of the Argives and their men of counsel:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.574">judge between the two of us now; and without favour;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.575">so that no man of the bronze-armoured Achaians shall say of us:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.576">"Menelaos using lies and force against Antilochos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.577">went off with the mare he won, for his horses were far slower</p>
	<p id="IL.23.578">but he himself was greater in power and degree." Or rather</p>
	<p id="IL.23.579">come, I myself will give the judgment, and I think no other</p>
	<p id="IL.23.580">man of the Danaans can call it in question, for it will be right.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.581">Antilochos, beloved of Zeus, come here. This is justice.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.582">Stand in front of your horses and chariot, and in your hand take</p>
	<p id="IL.23.583">up the narrow whip with which you drove them before, then</p>
	<p id="IL.23.584">lay your hand on the horses and swear by him who encircles</p>
	<p id="IL.23.585">the earth and shakes it you used no guile to baffle my chariot.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.586">Then in turn Antilochos of the good counsel answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.587">'Enough now. For I, my lord Menelaos, am younger</p>
	<p id="IL.23.588">by far than you, and you are the greater and go before me.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.589">You know how greedy transgressions flower in a young man, seeing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.590">that his mind is the more active but his judgment is lightweight. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.23.591">I would have your heart be patient with me. I myself will give you</p>
	<p id="IL.23.592">the mare I won, and if there were something still greater you asked for</p>
	<p id="IL.23.593">out of my house, I should still be willing at once to give it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.594">to you, beloved of Zeus, rather than all my days</p>
	<p id="IL.23.595">fall from your favour and be in the wrong before the divinities.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.596">He spoke, the son of Nestor the great-hearted, and leading</p>
	<p id="IL.23.597">the mare up gave her to Menelaos' hands. But his anger</p>
	<p id="IL.23.598">was softened, as with dew the ears of corn are softened</p>
	<p id="IL.23.599">in the standing corn growth of a shuddering field. For you also</p>
	<p id="IL.23.600">the heart, o Menelaos, was thus softened within you.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.601">He spoke to him aloud and addressed him in winged words: 'Antilochos,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.602">I myself, who was angry, now will give way before you,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.603">since you were not formerly loose-minded or vain. It is only</p>
	<p id="IL.23.604">that this time your youth got the better of your intelligence.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.605">Beware another time of playing tricks on your betters.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.606">Any other man of the Achaians might not have appeased me.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.607">But you have suffered much for me, and done much hard work,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.608">and your noble father, too, and your brother for my sake. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.23.609">I will be ruled by your supplication. I will even give you</p>
	<p id="IL.23.610">the mare, though she is mine, so that these men too may be witnesses</p>
	<p id="IL.23.611">that the heart is never arrogant nor stubborn within me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.612">He spoke, and gave Antilochos' companion, Noëmon,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.613">the mare to lead away, and himself took the glittering cauldron.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.614">Fourth, in the order he had driven, Meriones took up</p>
	<p id="IL.23.615">the two talents' weight of gold. But the fifth prize, the two-handled</p>
	<p id="IL.23.616">jar, was left. Achilleus carried it through the assembly</p>
	<p id="IL.23.617">of the Argives, and gave it to Nestor, and stood by and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.618">'This, aged sir, is yours to lay away as a treasure</p>
	<p id="IL.23.619">in memory of the burial of Patroklos; since never</p>
	<p id="IL.23.620">again will you see him among the Argives. I give you this prize</p>
	<p id="IL.23.621">for the giving; since never again will you fight with your fists nor wrestle,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.622">nor enter again the field for the spear-throwing, nor race</p>
	<p id="IL.23.623">on your feet; since now the hardship of old age is upon you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.624">He spoke, and put it in the hands of Nestor, who took it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.625">joyfully and spoke in answer and addressed him in winged words:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.626">'Yes, child: all this you said to me was true as you said it.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.627">My limbs are no longer steady, dear friend; not my feet, neither</p>
	<p id="IL.23.628">do my arms, as once they did, swing light from my shoulders.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.629">I wish I were young again and the strength still unshaken within me</p>
	<p id="IL.23.630">as once, when great Amaryngkeus was buried by the Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.23.631">at Bouprasion, and his sons gave games for a king's funeral.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.632">There there was no man like me, not among the Epeians</p>
	<p id="IL.23.633">nor yet of the Pylians themselves or great-hearted Aitolians.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.634">At boxing I won against Klytomedes, the son of Enops,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.635">at wrestling against Angkaios of Pleuron, who stood up against me.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.636">In the foot-race, for all his speed, I outran Iphiklos,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.637">and with the spear I out-threw Polydoros and Phyleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.638">It was only in the chariot-race that the sons of Aktor</p>
	<p id="IL.23.639">defeated me, crossing me in the crowd, so intent on winning</p>
	<p id="IL.23.640">were they, for the biggest prizes had been left for the horse-race.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.641">Now these sons of Aktor were twins; one held the reins at his leisure,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.642">held the reins at his leisure while the other lashed on the horses.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.643">This was I, once. Now it is for the young men to encounter</p>
	<p id="IL.23.644">in such actions, and for me to give way to the persuasion</p>
	<p id="IL.23.645">of gloomy old age. But once I shone among the young heroes.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.646">Go now, and honour the death of your companion with contests.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.647">I accept this from you gratefully, and my heart is happy</p>
	<p id="IL.23.648">that you have remembered me and my kindness, that I am not forgotten</p>
	<p id="IL.23.649">for the honour that should be my honour among the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.650">May the gods, for what you have done for me, give you great happiness.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.651">He spoke, and Peleides went back among the great numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.652">of Achaians assembled, when he had listened to all the praise spoken</p>
	<p id="IL.23.653">by Neleus' son, and set forth the prizes for the painful boxing.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.654">He led out into the field and tethered there a hard-working</p>
	<p id="IL.23.655">six-year-old unbroken jenny, the kind that is hardest</p>
	<p id="IL.23.656">to break; and for the loser set out a two-handled goblet.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.657">He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.658">'Son of Atreus, and all you other strong-greaved-Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.659">we invite two men, the best among you, to contend for these prizes</p>
	<p id="IL.23.660">with their hands up for the blows of boxing. He whom Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.23.661">grants to outlast the other, and all the Achaians witness it,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.662">let him lead away the hard-working jenny to his own shelter.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.663">The beaten man shall take away the two-handled goblet.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.664">He spoke, and a man huge and powerful, well skilled in boxing,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.665">rose up among them; the son of Panopeus, Epeios.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.666">He laid his hand on the hard-working jenny, and spoke out:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.667">'Let the man come up who will carry off the two-handled goblet.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.668">I say no other of the Achaians will beat me at boxing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.669">and lead off the jenny. I claim I am the champion. Is it not</p>
	<p id="IL.23.670">enough that I fall short in battle? Since it could not be</p>
	<p id="IL.23.671">ever, that a man could be a master in every endeavour.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.672">For I'tell you this straight out, and it will be a thing accomplished.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.673">I will smash his skin apart and break his bones on each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.674">Let those who care for him wait nearby in a huddle about him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.675">to carry him out, after my fists have beaten him under.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.676">So he spoke, and all of them stayed stricken to silence.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.677">Alone Euryalos stood up to face him, a godlike</p>
	<p id="IL.23.678">man, son of lord Mekisteus of the seed of Talaos;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.679">of him who came once to Thebes and the tomb of Oidipous after</p>
	<p id="IL.23.680">his downfall, and there in boxing defeated all the Kadmeians.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.681">The spear-famed son of Tydeus was his second, and talked to him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.682">in encouragement, and much desired the victory for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.683">First he pulled on the boxing belt about his waist, and then</p>
	<p id="IL.23.684">gave him the thongs carefully cut from the hide of a ranging</p>
	<p id="IL.23.685">ox. The two men, girt up, strode into the midst of the circle</p>
	<p id="IL.23.686">and faced each other, and put up their ponderous hands at the same time</p>
	<p id="IL.23.687">and closed, so that their heavy arms were crossing each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.688">and there was a fierce grinding of teeth, the sweat began to run</p>
	<p id="IL.23.689">everywhere from their bodies. Great Epeios came in, and hit him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.690">as he peered out from his guard, on the cheek, and he could no longer</p>
	<p id="IL.23.691">keep his feet, but where he stood the glorious limbs gave.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.692">As in the water roughened by the north wind a fish jumps</p>
	<p id="IL.23.693">in the weeds of the beach-break, then the dark water closes above him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.694">so Euryalos left the ground from the blow, but great-hearted Epeios</p>
	<p id="IL.23.695">took him in his arms and set him upright, and his true companions</p>
	<p id="IL.23.696">stood about him, and led him out of the circle, feet dragging</p>
	<p id="IL.23.697">as he spat up the thick blood and rolled his head over on one side.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.698">He was dizzy when they brought him back and set him among them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.699">But they themselves went and carried off the two-handled goblet.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.700">Now Peleides set forth the prizes for the third contest,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.701">for the painful wrestling, at once, and displayed them before the Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.702">There was a great tripod, to set over fire, for the winner.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.703">The Achaians among themselves valued it at the worth of twelve oxen.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.704">But for the beaten man he set in their midst a woman</p>
	<p id="IL.23.705">skilled in much work of her hands, and they rated her at four oxen.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.706">He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.707">'Rise up, two who would endeavour this prize.' So he spoke</p>
	<p id="IL.23.708">and presently there rose up huge Telamonian Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.709">and resourceful Odysseus rose, who was versed in every advantage.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.710">The two men, girt up, strode out into the midst of the circle,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.711">and grappled each other in the hook of their heavy arms, as when</p>
	<p id="IL.23.712">rafters lock, when a renowned architect has fitted them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.713">in the roof of a high house to keep out the force of the winds' spite.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.714">Their backs creaked under stress of violent hands that tugged them</p>
	<p id="IL.23.715">stubbornly, and the running sweat broke out, and raw places</p>
	<p id="IL.23.716">frequent all along their ribs and their shoulders broke out</p>
	<p id="IL.23.717">bright red with blood, as both of them kept up their hard efforts</p>
	<p id="IL.23.718">for success and the prize of the wrought tripod. Neither Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.719">was able to bring Aias down or throw him to the ground, nor</p>
	<p id="IL.23.720">could Aias, but the great strength of Odysseus held out against him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.721">But now as they made the strong-greaved Achaians begin to be restless,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.722">at last great Telamonian Aias said to the other:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.723">'Son of Laertes and seed of Zeus, resourceful Odysseus:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.724">lift me, or I will lift you. All success shall be as Zeus gives it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.725">He spoke, and heaved; but not forgetting his craft Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.726">caught him with a stroke behind the hollow of the knee, and unnerved</p>
	<p id="IL.23.727">the tendons, and threw him over backward, so that Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.728">fell on his chest as the people gazed upon them and wondered.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.729">Next, brilliant much-enduring Odysseus endeavoured to lift him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.730">and budged him a little from the ground, but still could not raise him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.731">clear, then hooked a knee behind, so that both of them went down</p>
	<p id="IL.23.732">together to the ground, and lay close, and were soiled in the dust. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.23.733">they would have sprung to their feet once more and wrestled a third fall,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.734">had not Achilleus himself stood up and spoken to stop them:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.735">'Wrestle no more now; do not wear yourselves out and get hurt.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.736">You have both won. Therefore take the prizes in equal division</p>
	<p id="IL.23.737">and retire, so the rest of the Achaians can have their contests.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.738">So he spoke, and they listened close to him and obeyed him</p>
	<p id="IL.23.739">and wiped the dust away from their bodies, and put on their tunics.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.740">At once the son of Peleus set out prizes for the foot-race:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.741">a mixing-bowl of silver, a work of art, which held only</p>
	<p id="IL.23.742">six measures, but for its loveliness it surpassed all others</p>
	<p id="IL.23.743">on earth by far, since skilled Sidonian craftsmen had wrought it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.744">well, and Phoenicians carried it over the misty face of the water</p>
	<p id="IL.23.745">and set it in the harbour, and gave it for a present to Thoas.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.746">Euneos, son of Jason, gave it to the hero Patroklos</p>
	<p id="IL.23.747">to buy Lykaon, Priam's son, out of slavery, and now</p>
	<p id="IL.23.748">Achilleus made it a prize in memory of his companion,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.749">for that man who should prove in the speed of his feet to run lightest.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.750">For second place he set out a great ox with fat deep upon him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.751">and for the last runner half a talent's weight of gold. He stood</p>
	<p id="IL.23.752">upright then and spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.753">'Rise up, you who would endeavour this prize.' So he spoke</p>
	<p id="IL.23.754">and presently there rose up swift Aias, the son of Oïleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.755">and Odysseus the resourceful rose up, and after him Nestor's</p>
	<p id="IL.23.756">son, Antilochos, the best runner among all the young men.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.757">They stood in line for the start, and Achilleus showed them the turn-post.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.758">The field was strung out from the scratch, and not long afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.23.759">Oïleus' son was out in front, but brilliant Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.760">overhauled him close, as near as to the breast of a woman</p>
	<p id="IL.23.761">fair-girdled is the rod she pulls in her hands carefully</p>
	<p id="IL.23.762">as she draws the spool out and along the warp, and holds it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.763">close to her chest. So Odysseus ran close up, but behind him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.764">and his feet were hitting the other's tracks before the dust settled.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.765">Great Odysseus was breathing on the back of the head of Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.23.766">as he ran and held his speed, and all the Achaians were shouting</p>
	<p id="IL.23.767">for his effort to win, and hallooed him hard along in his running.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.768">But as they were running the last part of the race, then Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.769">said a prayer inside his own mind to grey-eyed Athene:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.770">'Hear me, goddess; be kind; and come with strength for my footsteps.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.771">So he spoke in prayer, and Pallas Athene heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.772">She made his limbs light, both his feet and the hands above them.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.773">Now as they were for making their final sprint for the trophy,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.774">there Aias slipped in his running, for Athene unbalanced him,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.775">where dung was scattered on the ground from the bellowing oxen slaughtered</p>
	<p id="IL.23.776">by swift-footed Achilleus, those he slew to honour Patroklos;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.777">and his mouth and nose were filled with the cow dung, so that Odysseus</p>
	<p id="IL.23.778">the great and much enduring took off the mixing-bowl, seeing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.779">he had passed him and come in first, and the ox went to glorious Aias.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.780">He stood there holding in his hands the horn of the field-ox,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.781">spitting the dung from his mouth, and spoke his word to the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.782">'Ah, now! That goddess made me slip on my feet, who has always</p>
	<p id="IL.23.783">stood over Odysseus like a mother, and taken good care of him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.784">He spoke, and all the rest of them laughed happily at him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.785">In turn Antilochos took up prize for last place, and carried it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.786">off, and grinning spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.787">'Friends, you all know well what I tell you, that still the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.23.788">continue to favour the elder men. For see now, Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.23.789">is elder than I, if only by a little, but this man</p>
	<p id="IL.23.790">is out of another age than ours and one of the ancients.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.791">But his, they say, is a green old age. It would be a hard thing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.792">for any Achaian to match his speed. Except for Achilleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.793">So he spoke, and glorified the swift-footed Peleion.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.794">And Achilleus gave him an answer for what he said, and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.795">'Antilochos, your good word for me shall not have been spoken</p>
	<p id="IL.23.796">in vain. I shall give you another half-talent of gold in addition.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.797">He spoke, and put it in Antilochos' hands, who received it joyfully.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.798">Then the son of Peleus carried into the circle and set down</p>
	<p id="IL.23.799">a far-shadowing spear, and set down beside it a shield and a helmet:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.800">the armour of Sarpedon, that Patroklos stripped from his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.801">He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.802">'We invite two men, the best among you, to contend for these prizes.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.803">Let them draw their armour upon them and take up the rending bronze spears</p>
	<p id="IL.23.804">and stand up to each other in the trial of close combat. The fighter</p>
	<p id="IL.23.805">who is first of the two to get in a stroke at the other's fair body,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.806">to get through armour and dark blood and reach to the vitals,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.807">to that man I will give this magnificent silver-nailed</p>
	<p id="IL.23.808">sword of Thrace I stripped from the body of Asteropaios.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.809">But let both men carry off this armour and have it in common;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.810">and we shall set out a brave dinner before them both in our shelters.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.811">So he spoke, and there rose up huge Telamonian Aias,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.812">and next the son of Tydeus rose up, strong Diomedes.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.813">When these were in their armour on either side of the assembly,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.814">they came together in the middle space, furious for the combat,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.815">with dangerous looks, and wonder settled on all the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.816">Then as, moving forward, the two were closing in on each other,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.817">there were three charges, three times they swept in close. Then Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.23.818">stabbed at Diomedes' shield on its perfect circle</p>
	<p id="IL.23.819">but did not get through to the skin, for the corselet inside it guarded him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.820">The son of Tydeus, over the top of the huge shield, was always</p>
	<p id="IL.23.821">menacing the neck of Aias with the point of the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.23.822">spear, but when the Achaians saw it in fear for Aias</p>
	<p id="IL.23.823">they called for them to stop and divide the prizes evenly.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.824">But the hero Achilleus carried the great sword, with its scabbard</p>
	<p id="IL.23.825">and carefully cut sword belt, and gave it to Diomedes.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.826">Now the son of Peleus set in place a lump of pig-iron,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.827">which had once been the throwing-weight of Eëtion in his great strength;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.828">but now swift-footed brilliant Achilleus had slain him and taken</p>
	<p id="IL.23.829">the weight away in the ships along with the other possessions.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.830">He stood upright and spoke his word out among the Argives:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.831">'Rise up, you who would endeavour to win this prize also.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.832">For although the rich demesnes of him who wins it lie far off</p>
	<p id="IL.23.833">indeed, yet for the succession of five years he will have it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.834">to use; for his shepherd for want of iron will not have to go in</p>
	<p id="IL.23.835">to the city for it, nor his ploughman either. This will supply them.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.836">So he spoke, and up stood Polypoites the stubborn in battle,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.837">and Leonteus in his great strength, a godlike man, and there rose up</p>
	<p id="IL.23.838">Aias, the son of Telamon, and brilliant Epeios.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.839">They stood in order to throw, and great Epeios took up the weight</p>
	<p id="IL.23.840">and whirled and threw it, and all the Achaians laughed when they saw him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.841">Second to throw in turn was Leonteus, scion of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.842">and third in turn huge Telamonian Aias threw it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.843">from his ponderous hand, and overpassed the marks of all others.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.844">But when Polypoites stubborn in battle caught up the iron,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.845">he overthrew the entire field by as far as an ox-herd</p>
	<p id="IL.23.846">can cast with his throwing stick which spins through the air and comes down</p>
	<p id="IL.23.847">where the cattle graze in their herds, and all the Achaians applauded,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.848">and the companions of powerful Polypoites uprising</p>
	<p id="IL.23.849">carried the prize of the king away to the hollow vessels.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.850">But Achilleus set gloomy iron forth once more, for the archers.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.851">He set ten double-bladed axes forth, ten with single</p>
	<p id="IL.23.852">blades, and planted far away on the sands the mast pole</p>
	<p id="IL.23.853">of a dark-prowed ship, and tethered a tremulous wild pigeon to it</p>
	<p id="IL.23.854">by a thin string attached to her foot, then challenged the archers</p>
	<p id="IL.23.855">to shoot at her: 'Now let the man who hits the wild pigeon</p>
	<p id="IL.23.856">take up and carry away home with him all the full axes.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.857">But if one should miss the bird and still hit the string, that man,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.858">seeing that he is the loser, still shall have the half-axes.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.859">So he spoke, and there rose up in his strength the lord Teukros,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.860">and Meriones rose up, Idomeneus' powerful henchman.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.861">They chose their lots, and shook them up in a brazen helmet,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.862">and Teukros was allotted first place to shoot. He let fly</p>
	<p id="IL.23.863">a strong-shot arrow, but did not promise the lord of archery</p>
	<p id="IL.23.864">that he would accomplish for him a grand sacrifice of lambs first born.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.865">He missed the bird, for Apollo begrudged him that, but he did hit</p>
	<p id="IL.23.866">the string beside the foot where the bird was tied, and the tearing</p>
	<p id="IL.23.867">arrow went straight through and cut the string, and the pigeon</p>
	<p id="IL.23.868">soared swift up toward the sky, while the string dropped and dangled</p>
	<p id="IL.23.869">toward the ground. But still the Achaians thundered approval.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.870">Meriones in a fury of haste caught the bow from his hand,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.871">but had had out an arrow before, while Teukros was aiming,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.872">and forthwith promised to the one who strikes from afar, Apollo,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.873">that he would accomplish for him a grand sacrifice of lambs first born.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.874">Way up under the clouds he saw the tremulous wild dove</p>
	<p id="IL.23.875">and as she circled struck her under the wing in the body</p>
	<p id="IL.23.876">and the shaft passed clean through and out of her, so that it dropped back</p>
	<p id="IL.23.877">and stuck in the ground beside the foot of Meriones, but the bird</p>
	<p id="IL.23.878">dropped and fell on top of the mast of the dark-prowed vessel</p>
	<p id="IL.23.879">and drooped her neck and the beating wings went slack, and the spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.23.880">of life fled swift away from her limbs. Far down from the mast peak</p>
	<p id="IL.23.881">she dropped to earth. And the people gazed upon it and wondered.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.882">Then Meriones gathered up all ten double axes,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.883">but Teukros carried the half-axes back to the hollow ships.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.884">Then the son of Peleus carried into the circle and set down</p>
	<p id="IL.23.885">a far-shadowing spear and an unfired cauldron with patterns</p>
	<p id="IL.23.886">of flowers on it, the worth of an ox. And the spear-throwers rose up.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.887">The son of Atreus rose, wide-powerful Agamemnon,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.888">and Meriones rose up, Idomeneus' powerful henchman.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.889">But now among them spoke swift-footed brilliant Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.23.890">'Son of Atreus, for we know how much you surpass all others,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.891">by how much you are greatest for strength among the spear-throwers,</p>
	<p id="IL.23.892">therefore take this prize and keep it and go back to your hollow</p>
	<p id="IL.23.893">ships; but let us give the spear to the hero Meriones;</p>
	<p id="IL.23.894">if your own heart would have it this way, for so I invite you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.23.895">He spoke, nor did Agamemnon lord of men disobey him.</p>
	<p id="IL.23.896">The hero gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.23.897">handed his prize, surpassingly lovely, to the herald Talthybios.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.1">AND the games broke up, and the people scattered to go away, each man</p>
	<p id="IL.24.2">to his fast-running ship, and the rest of them took thought of their dinner</p>
	<p id="IL.24.3">and of sweet sleep and its enjoyment; only Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.4">wept still as he remembered his beloved companion, nor did sleep</p>
	<p id="IL.24.5">who subdues all come over him, but he tossed from one side to the other</p>
	<p id="IL.24.6">in longing for Patroklos, for his manhood and his great strength</p>
	<p id="IL.24.7">and all the actions he had seen to the end with him, and the hardships</p>
	<p id="IL.24.8">he had suffered; the wars of men; hard crossing of the big waters.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.9">Remembering all these things he let fall the swelling tears, lying</p>
	<p id="IL.24.10">sometimes along his side, sometimes on his back, and now again</p>
	<p id="IL.24.11">prone on his face; then he would stand upright, and pace turning</p>
	<p id="IL.24.12">in distraction along the beach of the sea, nor did dawn rising</p>
	<p id="IL.24.13">escape him as she brightened across the sea and the beaches.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.14">Then, when he had yoked running horses under the chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.24.15">he would fasten Hektor behind the chariot, so as to drag him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.16">and draw him three times around the tomb of Menoitios' fallen</p>
	<p id="IL.24.17">son, then rest again in his shelter, and throw down the dead man</p>
	<p id="IL.24.18">and leave him to lie sprawled on his face in the dust. But Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.24.19">had pity on him, though he was only a dead man, and guarded</p>
	<p id="IL.24.20">the body from all ugliness, and hid all of it under the golden</p>
	<p id="IL.24.21">aegis, so that it might not be torn when Achilleus dragged it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.22">So Achilleus in his standing fury outraged great Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.23">The blessed gods as they looked upon him were filled with compassion</p>
	<p id="IL.24.24">and kept urging clear-sighted Argeïphontes to steal the body.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.25">There this was pleasing to all the others, but never to Hera</p>
	<p id="IL.24.26">nor Poseidon, nor the girl of the grey eyes, who kept still</p>
	<p id="IL.24.27">their hatred for sacred Ilion as in the beginning,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.28">and for Priam and his people, because of the delusion of Paris</p>
	<p id="IL.24.29">who insulted the goddesses when they came to him in his courtyard</p>
	<p id="IL.24.30">and favoured her who supplied the lust that led to disaster.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.31">But now, as it was the twelfth dawn after the death of Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.32">Phoibos Apollo spoke his word out among the immortals:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.33">'You are hard, you gods, and destructive. Now did not Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.24.34">burn thigh pieces of oxen and unblemished goats in your honour?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.35">Now you cannot bring yourselves to save him, though he is only</p>
	<p id="IL.24.36">a corpse, for his wife to look upon, his child and his mother</p>
	<p id="IL.24.37">and Priam his father, and his people, who presently thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.24.38">would burn his body in the fire and give him his rites of burial.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.39">No, you gods; your desire is to help this cursed Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.40">within whose breast there are no feelings of justice, nor can</p>
	<p id="IL.24.41">his mind be bent, but his purposes are fierce, like a lion</p>
	<p id="IL.24.42">who when he has given way to his own great strength and his haughty</p>
	<p id="IL.24.43">spirit, goes among the flocks of men, to devour them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.44">So Achilleus has destroyed pity, and there is not in him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.45">any shame; which does much harm to men but profits them also.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.46">For a man must some day lose one who was even closer</p>
	<p id="IL.24.47">than this; a brother from the same womb, or a son. And yet</p>
	<p id="IL.24.48">he weeps for him, and sorrows for him, and then it is over,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.49">for the Destinies put in mortal men the heart of endurance.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.50">But this man, now he has torn the heart of life from great Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.51">ties him to his horses and drags him around his beloved companion's</p>
	<p id="IL.24.52">tomb; and nothing is gained thereby for his good, or his honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.53">Great as he is, let him take care not to make us angry;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.54">for see, he does dishonour to the dumb earth in his fury.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.55">Then bitterly Hera of the white arms answered him, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.56">'What you have said could be true, lord of the silver bow, only</p>
	<p id="IL.24.57">if you give Hektor such pride of place as you give to Achilleus.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.58">But Hektor was mortal, and suckled at the breast of a woman,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.59">while Achilleus is the child of a goddess, one whom I myself</p>
	<p id="IL.24.60">nourished and brought up and gave her as bride to her husband</p>
	<p id="IL.24.61">Peleus, one dear to the hearts of the immortals, for you all</p>
	<p id="IL.24.62">went, you gods, to the wedding; and you too feasted among them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.63">and held your lyre, o friend of the evil, faithless forever.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.64">In turn Zeus who gathers the clouds spoke to her in answer:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.65">'Hera, be not utterly angry with the gods, for there shall not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.66">be the same pride of place given both. Yet Hektor also</p>
	<p id="IL.24.67">was loved by the gods, best of all the mortals in Ilion.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.68">I loved him too. He never failed of gifts to my liking.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.69">Never yet has my altar gone without fair sacrifice,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.70">the smoke and the savour of it, since that is our portion of honour.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.71">The stealing of him we will dismiss, for it is not possible</p>
	<p id="IL.24.72">to take bold Hektor secretly from Achilleus, since always</p>
	<p id="IL.24.73">his mother is near him night and day; but it would be better</p>
	<p id="IL.24.74">if one of the gods would summon Thetis here to my presence</p>
	<p id="IL.24.75">so that I can say a close word to her, and see that Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.76">is given gifts by Priam and gives back the body of Hektor.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.77">He spoke, and Iris storm-footed sprang away with the message,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.78">and at a point between Samos and Imbros of the high cliffs</p>
	<p id="IL.24.79">plunged in the dark water, and the sea crashed moaning about her.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.80">She plummeted to the sea floor like a lead weight which, mounted</p>
	<p id="IL.24.81">along the horn of an ox who ranges the fields, goes downward</p>
	<p id="IL.24.82">and takes death with it to the raw-ravening fish. She found Thetis</p>
	<p id="IL.24.83">inside the hollow of her cave, and gathered about her</p>
	<p id="IL.24.84">sat the rest of the sea goddesses, and she in their midst</p>
	<p id="IL.24.85">was mourning the death of her blameless son, who so soon was destined</p>
	<p id="IL.24.86">to die in Troy of the rich soil, far from the land of his fathers.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.87">Iris the swift-foot came close beside her and spoke to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.88">'Rise, Thetis. Zeus whose purposes are infinite calls you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.89">In turn Thetis the goddess, the silver-footed, answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.90">'What does he, the great god, want with me? I feel shamefast</p>
	<p id="IL.24.91">to mingle with the immortals, and my heart is confused with sorrows.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.92">But I will go. No word shall be in vain, if he says it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.93">So she spoke, and shining among the divinities took up</p>
	<p id="IL.24.94">her black veil, and there is no darker garment. She went</p>
	<p id="IL.24.95">on her way, and in front of her rapid wind-footed Iris</p>
	<p id="IL.24.96">guided her, and the wave of the water opened about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.97">They stepped out on the dry land and swept to the sky. There they found</p>
	<p id="IL.24.98">the son of Kronos of the wide brows, and gathered about him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.99">sat all the rest of the gods, the blessed, who live forever.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.100">She sat down beside Zeus father, and Athene made a place for her.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.101">Hera put into her hand a beautiful golden goblet</p>
	<p id="IL.24.102">and spoke to her to comfort her, and Thetis accepting drank from it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.103">The father of gods and men began the discourse among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.104">'You have come to Olympos, divine Thetis, for all your sorrow,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.105">with an unforgotten grief in your heart. I myself know this.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.106">But even so I will tell you why I summoned you hither.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.107">For nine days there has risen a quarrel among the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.24.108">over the body of Hektor, and Achilleus, stormer of cities.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.109">They keep urging clear-sighted Argeïphontes to steal the body,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.110">but I still put upon Achilleus the honour that he has, guarding</p>
	<p id="IL.24.111">your reverence and your love for me into time afterwards. Go then</p>
	<p id="IL.24.112">in all speed to the encampment and give to your son this message:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.113">tell him that the gods frown upon him, that beyond all other</p>
	<p id="IL.24.114">immortals I myself am angered that in his heart's madness</p>
	<p id="IL.24.115">he holds Hektor beside the curved ships and did not give him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.116">back. Perhaps in fear of me he will give back Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.117">Then I will send Iris to Priam of the great heart, with an order</p>
	<p id="IL.24.118">to ransom his dear son, going down to the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.24.119">and bringing gifts to Achilleus which might soften his anger.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.120">He spoke and the goddess silver-foot Thetis did not disobey him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.121">but descended in a flash of speed from the peaks of Olympos</p>
	<p id="IL.24.122">and made her way to the shelter of her son, and there found him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.123">in close lamentation, and his beloved companions about him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.124">were busy at their work and made ready the morning meal, and there</p>
	<p id="IL.24.125">stood a great fleecy sheep being sacrificed in the shelter.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.126">His honoured mother came close to him and sat down beside him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.127">and stroked him with her hand and called him by name and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.128">'My child, how long will you go on eating your heart out in sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.24.129">and lamentation, and remember neither your food nor going</p>
	<p id="IL.24.130">to bed? It is a good thing even to lie with a woman</p>
	<p id="IL.24.131">in love. For you will not be with me long, but already</p>
	<p id="IL.24.132">death and powerful destiny stand closely above you.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.133">But listen hard to me, for I come from Zeus with a message.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.134">He says that the gods frown upon you, that beyond all other</p>
	<p id="IL.24.135">immortals he himself is angered that in your heart's madness</p>
	<p id="IL.24.136">you hold Hektor beside the curved ships and did not redeem him.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.137">Come, then, give him up and accept ransom for the body.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.138">Then in turn Achilleus of the swift feet answered her:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.139">'So be it. He can bring the ransom and take off the body,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.140">if the Olympian himself so urgently bids it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.141">So, where the ships were drawn together, the son and his mother</p>
	<p id="IL.24.142">conversed at long length in winged words. But the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.24.143">stirred Iris to go down to sacred Ilion, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.144">'Go forth, Iris the swift, leaving your place on Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.145">and go to Priam of the great heart within Ilion, tell him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.146">to ransom his dear son, going down to the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.24.147">and bringing gifts to Achilleus which might soften his anger:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.148">alone, let no other man of the Trojans go with him, but only</p>
	<p id="IL.24.149">let one elder herald attend him, one who can manage</p>
	<p id="IL.24.150">the mules and the easily running wagon, so he can carry</p>
	<p id="IL.24.151">the dead man, whom great Achilleus slew, back to the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.152">Let death not be a thought in his heart, let him have no fear;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.153">such an escort shall I send to guide him, Argeïphontes</p>
	<p id="IL.24.154">who shall lead him until he brings him to Achilleus. And after</p>
	<p id="IL.24.155">he has brought him inside the shelter of Achilleus, neither</p>
	<p id="IL.24.156">will the man himself kill him, but will hold back all the others,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.157">for he is no witless man nor unwatchful, nor is he wicked,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.158">but will in all kindness spare one who comes to him as a suppliant.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.159">He spoke, and storm-footed Iris swept away with the message</p>
	<p id="IL.24.160">and came to the house of Priam. There she found outcry and mourning.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.161">The sons sitting around their father inside the courtyard</p>
	<p id="IL.24.162">made their clothes sodden with their tears, and among them the old man</p>
	<p id="IL.24.163">sat veiled, beaten into his mantle. Dung lay thick</p>
	<p id="IL.24.164">on the head and neck of the aged man, for he had been rolling</p>
	<p id="IL.24.165">in it, he had gathered and smeared it on with his hands. And his daughters</p>
	<p id="IL.24.166">all up and down the house and the wives of his sons were mourning</p>
	<p id="IL.24.167">as they remembered all those men in their numbers and valour</p>
	<p id="IL.24.168">who lay dead, their lives perished at the hands of the Argives.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.169">The messenger of Zeus stood beside Priam and spoke to him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.170">in a small voice, and yet the shivers took hold of his body:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.171">'Take heart, Priam, son of Dardanos, do not be frightened.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.172">I come to you not eyeing you with evil intention</p>
	<p id="IL.24.173">but with the purpose of good toward you. I am a messenger</p>
	<p id="IL.24.174">of Zeus, who far away cares much for you and is pitiful.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.175">The Olympian orders you to ransom Hektor the brilliant,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.176">to bring gifts to Achilleus which may soften his anger:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.177">alone, let no other man of the Trojans go with you, but only</p>
	<p id="IL.24.178">let one elder herald attend you, one who can manage</p>
	<p id="IL.24.179">the mules and the easily running wagon, so he can carry</p>
	<p id="IL.24.180">the dead man, whom great Achilleus slew, back to the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.181">Let death not be a thought in your heart, you need have no fear,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.182">such an escort shall go with you to guide you, Argeïphontes</p>
	<p id="IL.24.183">who will lead you till he brings you to Achilleus. And after</p>
	<p id="IL.24.184">he has brought you inside the shelter of Achilleus, neither</p>
	<p id="IL.24.185">will the man himself kill you but will hold back all the others;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.186">for he is no witless man nor unwatchful, nor is he wicked</p>
	<p id="IL.24.187">but will in all kindness spare one who comes to him as a suppliant.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.188">So Iris the swift-footed spoke and went away from him.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.189">Thereupon he ordered his sons to make ready the easily rolling</p>
	<p id="IL.24.190">mule wagon, and to fasten upon it the carrying basket.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.191">He himself went into the storeroom, which was fragrant</p>
	<p id="IL.24.192">and of cedar, and high-ceilinged, with many bright treasures inside it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.193">He called out to Hekabe his wife, and said to her:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.194">'Dear wife, a messenger came to me from Zeus on Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.195">that I must go to the ships of the Achaians and ransom my dear son,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.196">bringing gifts to Achilleus which may soften his anger.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.197">Come then, tell me. What does it seem best to your own mind</p>
	<p id="IL.24.198">for me to do? My heart, my strength are terribly urgent</p>
	<p id="IL.24.199">that I go there to the ships within the wide army of the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.200">So he spoke, and his wife cried out aloud, and answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.201">'Ah me, where has that wisdom gone for which you were famous</p>
	<p id="IL.24.202">in time before, among outlanders and those you rule over?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.203">How can you wish to go alone to the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.24.204">before the eyes of a man who has slaughtered in such numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.24.205">such brave sons of yours? The heart in you is iron. For if</p>
	<p id="IL.24.206">he has you within his grasp and lays eyes upon you, that man</p>
	<p id="IL.24.207">who is savage and not to be trusted will not take pity upon you</p>
	<p id="IL.24.208">nor have respect for your rights. Let us sit apart in our palace</p>
	<p id="IL.24.209">now, and weep for Hektor, and the way at the first strong Destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.24.210">spun with his life line when he was born, when I gave birth to him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.211">that the dogs with their shifting feet should feed on him, far from his parents,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.212">gone down before a stronger man; I wish I could set teeth</p>
	<p id="IL.24.213">in the middle of his liver and eat it. That would be vengeance</p>
	<p id="IL.24.214">for what he did to my son; for he slew him when he was no coward</p>
	<p id="IL.24.215">but standing before the men of Troy and the deep-girdled women</p>
	<p id="IL.24.216">of Troy, with no thought in his mind of flight or withdrawal.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.217">In turn the aged Priam, the godlike, answered her saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.218">'Do not hold me back when I would be going, neither yourself be</p>
	<p id="IL.24.219">a bird of bad omen in my palace. You will not persuade me.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.220">If it had been some other who ordered me, one of the mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.221">one of those who are soothsayers, or priests, or diviners,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.222">I might have called it a lie and we might rather have rejected it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.223">But now, for I myself heard the god and looked straight upon her,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.224">I am going, and this word shall not be in vain. If it is my destiny</p>
	<p id="IL.24.225">to die there by the ships of the bronze-armoured Achaians,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.226">then I wish that. Achilleus can slay me at once, with my own son</p>
	<p id="IL.24.227">caught in my arms, once I have my fill of mourning above him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.228">He spoke, and lifted back the fair covering of his clothes-chest</p>
	<p id="IL.24.229">and from inside took out twelve robes surpassingly lovely</p>
	<p id="IL.24.230">and twelve mantles to be worn single, as many blankets,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.231">as many great white cloaks, also the same number of tunics.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.232">He weighed and carried out ten full talents of gold, and brought forth</p>
	<p id="IL.24.233">two shining tripods, and four cauldrons, and brought out a goblet</p>
	<p id="IL.24.234">of surpassing loveliness that the men of Thrace had given him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.235">when he went to them with a message, but now the old man spared not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.236">even this in his halls, so much was it his heart's desire</p>
	<p id="IL.24.237">to ransom back his beloved son. But he drove off the Trojans</p>
	<p id="IL.24.238">all from his cloister walks, scolding them with words of revilement:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.239">'Get out, you failures, you disgraces. Have you not also</p>
	<p id="IL.24.240">mourning of your own at home that you come to me with your sorrows?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.241">Is it not enought that Zeus, son of Kronos, has given me sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.24.242">in losing the best of my sons? You also shall be aware of this</p>
	<p id="IL.24.243">since you will be all the easier for the Achaians to slaughter</p>
	<p id="IL.24.244">now he is dead. But, for myself, before my eyes look</p>
	<p id="IL.24.245">upon this city as it is destroyed and its people are slaughtered,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.246">my wish is to go sooner down to the house of the death god.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.247">He spoke, and went after the men with a stick, and they fled outside</p>
	<p id="IL.24.248">before the fury of the old man. He was scolding his children</p>
	<p id="IL.24.249">and cursing Helenos, and Paris, Agathon the brilliant,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.250">Pammon and Antiphonos, Polites of the great war cry,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.251">Deïphobos and Hippothoös and proud Dios. There were nine</p>
	<p id="IL.24.252">sons to whom now the old man gave orders and spoke to them roughly:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.253">'Make haste, wicked children, my disgraces. I wish all of you</p>
	<p id="IL.24.254">had been killed beside the running ships in the place of Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.255">Ah me, for my evil destiny. I have had the noblest</p>
	<p id="IL.24.256">of sons in Troy, but I say not one of them is left to me,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.257">Mestor like a god and Troilos whose delight was in horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.258">and Hektor, who was a god among men, for he did not seem like</p>
	<p id="IL.24.259">one who was child of a mortal man, but of a god. All these</p>
	<p id="IL.24.260">Ares has killed, and all that are left me are the disgraces,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.261">the liars and the dancers, champions of the chorus, the plunderers</p>
	<p id="IL.24.262">of their own people in their land of lambs and kids. Well then,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.263">will you not get my wagon ready and be quick about it,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.264">and put all these things on it, so we can get on with our journey?'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.265">So he spoke, and they in terror at the old man's scolding</p>
	<p id="IL.24.266">hauled out the easily running wagon for mules, a fine thing</p>
	<p id="IL.24.267">new-fabricated, and fastened the carrying basket upon it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.268">They took away from its peg the mule yoke made of boxwood</p>
	<p id="IL.24.269">with its massive knob, well fitted with guiding rings, and brought forth</p>
	<p id="IL.24.270">the yoke lashing (together with the yoke itself) of nine cubits</p>
	<p id="IL.24.271">and snugged it well into place upon the smooth-polished wagon-pole</p>
	<p id="IL.24.272">at the foot of the beam, then slipped the ring over the peg, and lashed it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.273">with three turns on either side to the knob, and afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.24.274">fastened it all in order and secured it under a hooked guard.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.275">Then they carried out and piled into the smooth-polished mule wagon</p>
	<p id="IL.24.276">all the unnumbered spoils to be given for the head of Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.277">then yoked the powerful-footed mules who pulled in the harness</p>
	<p id="IL.24.278">and whom the Mysians gave once as glorious presents to Priam;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.279">but for Priam they led under the yoke those horses the old man</p>
	<p id="IL.24.280">himself had kept, and cared for them at his polished manger.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.281">Now in the high house the yoking was done for the herald</p>
	<p id="IL.24.282">and Priam, men both with close counsels in their minds. And now came</p>
	<p id="IL.24.283">Hekabe with sorrowful heart and stood close beside them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.284">carrying in her right hand the kind, sweet wine in a golden</p>
	<p id="IL.24.285">goblet, so that before they went they might pour a drink-offering.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.286">She stood in front of the horses, called Priam by name and spoke to him:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.287">'Here, pour a libation to Zeus father, and pray you may come back</p>
	<p id="IL.24.288">home again from those who hate you, since it seems the spirit</p>
	<p id="IL.24.289">within you drives you upon the ships, though I would not have it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.290">Make your prayer then to the dark-misted, the son of Kronos</p>
	<p id="IL.24.291">on Ida, who looks out on all the Troad, and ask him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.292">for a bird of omen, a rapid messenger, which to his own mind</p>
	<p id="IL.24.293">is dearest of all birds and his strength is the biggest, one seen</p>
	<p id="IL.24.294">on the right, so that once your eyes have rested upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.295">you can trust in him and go to the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.296">But if Zeus of the wide brows will not grant you his own messenger,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.297">then I, for one, would never urge you on nor advise you</p>
	<p id="IL.24.298">to go to the Argive ships, for all your passion to do it.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.299">Then in answer to her again spoke Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.300">'My lady, I will not disregard this wherein you urge me.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.301">It is well to lift hands to Zeus and ask if he will have mercy.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.302">The old man spoke, and told the housekeeper who attended them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.303">to pour unstained water over his hands. She standing beside them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.304">and serving them held the washing-bowl in her hands, and a pitcher.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.305">He washed his hands and took the cup from his wife. He stood up</p>
	<p id="IL.24.306">in the middle of the enclosure, and prayed, and poured the wine out</p>
	<p id="IL.24.307">looking up into the sky, and gave utterance and spoke, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.308">'Father Zeus, watching over us from Ida, most high, most honoured:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.309">grant that I come to Achilleus for love and pity; but send me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.310">a bird of omen, a rapid messenger which to your own mind</p>
	<p id="IL.24.311">is dearest of all birds and his strength is biggest, one seen</p>
	<p id="IL.24.312">on the right, so that once my eyes have rested upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.313">I may trust in him and go to the ships of the fast-mounted Danaans.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.314">So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus of the counsels heard him.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.315">Straightway he sent down the most lordly of birds, an eagle,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.316">the dark one, the marauder, called as well the black eagle.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.317">And as big as is the build of the door to a towering chamber</p>
	<p id="IL.24.318">in the house of a rich man, strongly fitted with bars, of such size</p>
	<p id="IL.24.319">was the spread of his wings on either side. He swept through the city</p>
	<p id="IL.24.320">appearing on the right hand, and the people looking upon him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.321">were uplifted and the hearts made glad in the breasts of all of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.322">Now in urgent haste the old man mounted into his chariot</p>
	<p id="IL.24.323">and drove out through the forecourt and the thundering close. Before him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.324">the mules hauled the wagon on its four wheels, Idaios</p>
	<p id="IL.24.325">the sober-minded driving them, and behind him the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.24.326">came on as the old man laid the lash upon them and urged them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.327">rapidly through the town, and all his kinsmen were following</p>
	<p id="IL.24.328">much lamenting, as if he went to his death. When the two men</p>
	<p id="IL.24.329">had gone down through the city, and out, and come to the flat land,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.330">the rest of them turned back to go to Ilion, the sons</p>
	<p id="IL.24.331">and the sons-in-law. And Zeus of the wide brows failed not to notice</p>
	<p id="IL.24.332">the two as they showed in the plain. He saw the old man and took pity</p>
	<p id="IL.24.333">upon him, and spoke directly to his beloved son, Hermes:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.334">'Hermes, for to you beyond all other gods it is dearest</p>
	<p id="IL.24.335">to be man's companion, and you listen to whom you will, go now</p>
	<p id="IL.24.336">on your way, and so guide Priam inside the hollow ships</p>
	<p id="IL.24.337">of the Achaians, that no man shall see him, none be aware of him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.338">of the other Danaans, till he has come to the son of Peleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.339">He spoke, nor disobeyed him the courier, Argeïphontes.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.340">Immediately he bound upon his feet the fair sandals</p>
	<p id="IL.24.341">golden and immortal, that carried him over the water</p>
	<p id="IL.24.342">as over the dry land of the main abreast of the wind's blast.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.343">He caught up the staff, with which he mazes the eyes of those mortals</p>
	<p id="IL.24.344">whose eyes he would maze, or wakes again the sleepers. Holding</p>
	<p id="IL.24.345">this in his hands, strong Argeïphontes winged his way onward</p>
	<p id="IL.24.346">until he came suddenly to Troy and the Hellespont, and there</p>
	<p id="IL.24.347">walked on, and there took the likeness of a young man, a noble,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.348">with beard new grown, which is the most graceful time of young manhood.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.349">Now when the two had driven past the great tomb of Ilos</p>
	<p id="IL.24.350">they stayed their mules and horses to water them in the river,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.351">for by this time darkness had descended on the land; and the herald</p>
	<p id="IL.24.352">made out Hermes, who was coming toward them at a short distance.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.353">He lifted his voice and spoke aloud to Priam: 'Take thought,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.354">son of Dardanos. Here is work for a mind that is careful.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.355">I see a man; I think he will presently tear us to pieces.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.356">Come then, let us run away with our horses, or if not, then</p>
	<p id="IL.24.357">clasp his knees and entreat him to have mercy upon us.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.358">So he spoke, and the old man's mind was confused, he was badly</p>
	<p id="IL.24.359">frightened, and the hairs stood up all over his gnarled body</p>
	<p id="IL.24.360">and he stood staring, but the kindly god himself coming closer</p>
	<p id="IL.24.361">took the old man's hand, and spoke to him and asked him a question</p>
	<p id="IL.24.362">'Where, my father, are you thus guiding your mules and horses</p>
	<p id="IL.24.363">through the immortal night while other mortals are sleeping?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.364">Have you no fear of the Achaians whose wind is fury,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.365">who hate you, who are your enemies, and are near? For if one</p>
	<p id="IL.24.366">of these were to see you, how you are conveying so many</p>
	<p id="IL.24.367">treasures through the swift black night, what then could you think of?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.368">You are not young yourself, and he who attends you is aged</p>
	<p id="IL.24.369">for beating off any man who might pick a quarrel with you.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.370">But I will do you no harm myself, I will even keep off</p>
	<p id="IL.24.371">another who would. You seem to me like a beloved father.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.372">In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.373">'Yes, in truth, dear child, all this is much as you tell me;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.374">yet still there is some god who has held his hand above me,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.375">who sent such a wayfarer as you to meet me, an omen</p>
	<p id="IL.24.376">of good, for such you are by your form, your admired beauty</p>
	<p id="IL.24.377">and the wisdom in your mind. Your parents are fortunate in you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.378">Then in turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.379">'Yes, old sir, all this that you said is fair and orderly.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.380">But come, tell me this thing and recite it to me accurately.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.381">Can it be you convey these treasures in all their numbers and beauty</p>
	<p id="IL.24.382">to outland men, so that they can be still kept safe for you?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.383">Or are all of you by now abandoning sacred Ilion</p>
	<p id="IL.24.384">in fear, such a one was he who died, the best man among you,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.385">your son; who was never wanting when you fought against the Achaians.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.386">In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.387">'But who are you, o best of men, and who are your parents?</p>
	<p id="IL.24.388">Since you spoke of my ill-starred son's death, and with honour.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.389">Then in turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.390">'You try me out, aged sir. You ask me of glorious Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.24.391">whom many a time my eyes have seen in the fighting where men win</p>
	<p id="IL.24.392">glory, as also on that time when he drove back the Argives</p>
	<p id="IL.24.393">on their ships and kept killing them with the stroke of the sharp bronze,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.394">and we stood by and wondered at him; for then Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.395">would not let us fight by reason of his anger at Agamemnon.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.396">For I am Achilleus' henchman, and the same strong-wrought vessel</p>
	<p id="IL.24.397">brought us here; and I am a Myrmidon, and my father</p>
	<p id="IL.24.398">is Polyktor; a man of substance, but aged, as you are.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.399">He has six sons beside, and I am the seventh, and I shook</p>
	<p id="IL.24.400">lots with the others, and it was my lot to come on this venture.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.401">But now I have come to the plain away from the ships, for at daybreak</p>
	<p id="IL.24.402">the glancing-eyed Achaians will do battle around the city.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.403">They chafe from sitting here too long, nor have the Achaians'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.404">kings the strength to hold them back as they break for the fighting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.405">In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.406">'If then you are henchman to Peleïd Achilleus,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.407">come, tell me the entire truth, and whether my son lies</p>
	<p id="IL.24.408">still beside the ships, or whether by now he has been hewn</p>
	<p id="IL.24.409">limb from limb and thrown before the dogs by Achilleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.410">Then in turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.411">'Aged sir, neither have any dogs eaten him, nor have</p>
	<p id="IL.24.412">the birds, but he lies yet beside the ship of Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.413">at the shelters, and as he was; now here is the twelfth dawn</p>
	<p id="IL.24.414">he has lain there, nor does his flesh decay, nor do worms feed</p>
	<p id="IL.24.415">on him, they who devour men who have fallen in battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.416">It is true, Achilleus drags him at random around his beloved</p>
	<p id="IL.24.417">companion's tomb, as dawn on dawn appears, yet he cannot</p>
	<p id="IL.24.418">mutilate him; you yourself can see when you go there</p>
	<p id="IL.24.419">how fresh with dew he lies, and the blood is all washed from him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.420">nor is there any corruption, and all the wounds have been closed up</p>
	<p id="IL.24.421">where he was struck, since many drove the bronze in his body.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.422">So it is that the blessed immortals care for your son, though</p>
	<p id="IL.24.423">he is nothing but a dead man; because in their hearts they loved him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.424">He spoke, and the old man was made joyful and answered him, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.425">'My child, surely it is good to give the immortals</p>
	<p id="IL.24.426">their due gifts; because my own son, if ever I had one,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.427">never forgot in his halls the gods who live on Olympos.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.428">Therefore they remembered him even in death's stage. Come, then,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.429">accept at my hands this beautiful drinking-cup, and give me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.430">protection for my body, and with the gods' grace be my escort</p>
	<p id="IL.24.431">until I make my way to the shelter of the son of Peleus.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.432">In turn answered him the courier Argeïphontes:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.433">'You try me out, aged sir, for I am young, but you will not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.434">persuade me, telling me to accept your gifts when Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.435">does not know. I fear him at heart and have too much reverence</p>
	<p id="IL.24.436">to rob him. Such a thing might be to my sorrow hereafter.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.437">But I would be your escort and take good care of you, even</p>
	<p id="IL.24.438">till I came to glorious Argos in a fast ship or following</p>
	<p id="IL.24.439">on foot, and none would fight you because he despised your escort.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.440">The kind god spoke, and sprang up behind the horses and into</p>
	<p id="IL.24.441">the chariot, and rapidly caught in his hands the lash and the guide reins,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.442">and breathed great strength into the mules and horses. Now after</p>
	<p id="IL.24.443">they had got to the fortifications about the ships, and the ditch, there</p>
	<p id="IL.24.444">were sentries, who had just begun to make ready their dinner,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.445">but about these the courier Argeïphontes drifted</p>
	<p id="IL.24.446">sleep, on all, and quickly opened the gate, and shoved back</p>
	<p id="IL.24.447">the door-bars, and brought in Priam and the glorious gifts on the wagon.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.448">But when they had got to the shelter of Peleus' son: a towering</p>
	<p id="IL.24.449">shelter the Myrmidons had built for their king, hewing</p>
	<p id="IL.24.450">the timbers of pine, and they made a roof of thatch above it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.451">shaggy with grass that they had gathered out of the meadows;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.452">and around it made a great courtyard for their king, with hedgepoles</p>
	<p id="IL.24.453">set close together; the gate was secured by a single door-piece</p>
	<p id="IL.24.454">of pine, and three Achaians could ram it home in its socket</p>
	<p id="IL.24.455">and three could pull back and open the huge door-bar; three other</p>
	<p id="IL.24.456">Achaians, that is, but Achilleus all by himself could close it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.457">At this time Hermes, the kind god, opened the gate for the old man</p>
	<p id="IL.24.458">and brought in the glorious gifts for Peleus' son, the swift-footed,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.459">and dismounted to the ground from behind the horses, and spoke forth:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.460">'Aged sir, I who came to you am a god immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.461">Hermes. My father sent me down to guide and go with you.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.462">But now I am going back again, and I will not go in</p>
	<p id="IL.24.463">before the eyes of Achilleus, for it would make others angry</p>
	<p id="IL.24.464">for an immortal god so to face mortal men with favour.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.465">But go you in yourself and clasp the knees of Peleion</p>
	<p id="IL.24.466">and entreat him in the name of his father, the name of his mother</p>
	<p id="IL.24.467">of the lovely hair, and his child, and so move the spirit within him.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.468">So Hermes spoke, and went away to the height of Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.469">but Priam vaulted down to the ground from behind the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.24.470">and left Idaios where he was, for he stayed behind, holding</p>
	<p id="IL.24.471">in hand the horses and mules. The old man made straight for the dwelling</p>
	<p id="IL.24.472">where Achilleus the beloved of Zeus was sitting. He found him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.473">inside, and his companions were sitting apart, as two only,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.474">Automedon the hero and Alkimos, scion of Ares,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.475">were busy beside him. He had just now got through with his dinner,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.476">with eating and drinking, and the table still stood by. Tall Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.24.477">came in unseen by the other men and stood close beside him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.478">and caught the knees of Achilleus in his arms, and kissed the hands</p>
	<p id="IL.24.479">that were dangerous and manslaughtering and had killed so many</p>
	<p id="IL.24.480">of his sons. As when dense disaster closes on one who has murdered</p>
	<p id="IL.24.481">a man in his own land, and he comes to the country of others,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.482">to a man of substance, and wonder seizes on those who behold him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.483">so Achilleus wondered as he looked on Priam, a godlike</p>
	<p id="IL.24.484">man, and the rest of them wondered also, and looked at each other.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.485">But now Priam spoke to him in the words of a suppliant:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.486">'Achilleus like the gods, remember your father, one who</p>
	<p id="IL.24.487">is of years like mine, and on the door-sill of sorrowful old age.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.488">And they who dwell nearby encompass him and afflict him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.489">nor is there any to defend him against the wrath, the destruction.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.490">Yet surely he, when he hears of you and that you are still living,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.491">is gladdened within his heart and all his days he is hopeful</p>
	<p id="IL.24.492">that he will see his beloved son come home from the Troad.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.493">But for me, my destiny was evil. I have had the noblest</p>
	<p id="IL.24.494">of sons in Troy, but I say not one of them is left to me.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.495">Fifty were my sons, when the sons of the Achaians came here.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.496">Nineteen were born to me from the womb of a single mother,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.497">and other women bore the rest in my palace; and of these</p>
	<p id="IL.24.498">violent Ares broke the strength in the knees of most of them,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.499">but one was left me who guarded my city and people, that one</p>
	<p id="IL.24.500">you killed a few days since as he fought in defence of his country,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.501">Hektor; for whose sake I come now to the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.24.502">to win him back from you, and I bring you gifts beyond number.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.503">Honour then the gods, Achilleus, and take pity upon me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.504">remembering your father, yet I am still more pitiful;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.505">I have gone through what no other mortal on earth has gone through;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.506">I put my lips to the hands of the man who has killed my children.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.507">So he spoke, and stirred in the other a passion of grieving</p>
	<p id="IL.24.508">for his own father. He took the old man's hand and pushed him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.509">gently away, and the two remembered, as Priam sat huddled</p>
	<p id="IL.24.510">at the feet of Achilleus and wept close for manslaughtering Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.24.511">and Achilleus wept now for his own father, now again</p>
	<p id="IL.24.512">for Patroklos. The sound of their mourning moved in the house. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.24.513">when great Achilleus had taken full satisfaction in sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.24.514">and the passion for it had gone from his mind and body, thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.24.515">he rose from his chair, and took the old man by the hand, and set him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.516">on his feet again, in pity for the grey head and the grey beard,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.517">and spoke to him and addressed him in winged words: 'Ah, unlucky,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.518">surely you have had much evil to endure in your spirit.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.519">How could you dare to come alone to the ships of the Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.24.520">and before my eyes, when I am one who have killed in such numbers</p>
	<p id="IL.24.521">such brave sons of yours? The heart in you is iron. Come, then,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.522">and sit down upon this chair, and you and I will even let</p>
	<p id="IL.24.523">our sorrows lie still in the heart for all our grieving. There is not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.524">any advantage to be won from grim lamentation.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.525">Such is the way the gods spun life for unfortunate mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.526">that we live in unhappiness, but the gods themselves have no sorrows.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.527">There are two urns that stand on the door-sill of Zeus. They are unlike</p>
	<p id="IL.24.528">for the gifts they bestow: an urn of evils, an urn of blessings.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.529">If Zeus who delights in thunder mingles these and bestows them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.530">on man, he shifts, and moves now in evil, again in good fortune.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.531">But when Zeus bestows from the urn of sorrows, he makes a failure</p>
	<p id="IL.24.532">of man, and the evil hunger drives him over the shining</p>
	<p id="IL.24.533">earth, and he wanders respected neither of gods nor mortals.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.534">Such were the shining gifts given by the gods to Peleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.535">from his birth, who outshone all men beside for his riches</p>
	<p id="IL.24.536">and pride of possession, and was lord over the Myrmidons. Thereto</p>
	<p id="IL.24.537">the gods bestowed an immortal wife on him, who was mortal.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.538">But even on him the god piled evil also. There was not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.539">any generation of strong sons born to him in his great house</p>
	<p id="IL.24.540">but a single all-untimely child he had, and I give him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.541">no care as he grows old, since far from the land of my fathers</p>
	<p id="IL.24.542">I sit here in Troy, and bring nothing but sorrow to you and your children.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.543">And you, old sir, we are told you prospered once; for as much</p>
	<p id="IL.24.544">as Lesbos, Makar's hold, confines to the north above it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.545">and Phrygia from the north confines, and enormous Hellespont,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.546">of these, old sir, you were lord once in your wealth and your children.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.547">But now the Uranian gods brought us, an affliction upon you,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.548">forever there is fighting about your city, and men killed.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.549">But bear up, nor mourn endlessly in your heart, for there is not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.550">anything to be gained from grief for your son; you will never</p>
	<p id="IL.24.551">bring him back; sooner you must go through yet another sorrow.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.552">In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.553">'Do not, beloved of Zeus, make me sit on a chair while Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.24.554">lies yet forlorn among the shelters; rather with all speed</p>
	<p id="IL.24.555">give him back, so my eyes may behold him, and accept the ransom</p>
	<p id="IL.24.556">we bring you, which is great. You may have joy of it, and go back</p>
	<p id="IL.24.557">to the land of your own fathers, since once you have permitted me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.558">to go on living myself and continue to look on the sunlight.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.559">Then looking darkly at him spoke swift-footed Achilleus:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.560">'No longer stir me up, old sir. I myself am minded</p>
	<p id="IL.24.561">to give Hektor back to you. A messenger came to me from Zeus,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.562">my mother, she who bore me, the daughter of the sea's ancient.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.563">I know you, Priam, in my heart, and it does not escape me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.564">that some god led you to the running ships of the Achaians.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.565">For no mortal would dare come to our encampment, not even</p>
	<p id="IL.24.566">one strong in youth. He could not get by the pickets, he could not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.567">lightly unbar the bolt that secures our gateway. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.24.568">you must not further make my spirit move in my sorrows,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.569">for fear, old sir, I might not let you alone in my shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.570">suppliant as you are; and be guilty before the god's orders.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.571">He spoke, and the old man was frightened and did as he told him.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.572">The son of Peleus bounded to the door of the house like a lion,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.573">nor went alone, but the two henchmen followed attending,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.574">the hero Automedon and Alkimos, those whom Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.575">honoured beyond all companions after Patroklos dead. These two</p>
	<p id="IL.24.576">now set free from under the yoke the mules and the horses,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.577">and led inside the herald, the old king's crier, and gave him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.578">a chair to sit in, then from the smooth-polished mule wagon</p>
	<p id="IL.24.579">lifted out the innumerable spoils for the head of Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.580">but left inside it two great cloaks and a finespun tunic</p>
	<p id="IL.24.581">to shroud the corpse in when they carried him home. Then Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.582">called out to his serving-maids to wash the body and anoint it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.583">all over; but take it first aside, since otherwise Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.24.584">might see his son and in the heart's sorrow not hold in his anger</p>
	<p id="IL.24.585">at the sight, and the deep heart in Achilleus be shaken to anger;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.586">that he might not kill Priam and be guilty before the god's orders.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.587">Then when the serving-maids had washed the corpse and anointed it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.588">with olive oil, they threw a fair great cloak and a tunic</p>
	<p id="IL.24.589">about him, and Achilleus himself lifted him and laid him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.590">on a litter, and his friends helped him lift it to the smooth-polished</p>
	<p id="IL.24.591">mule wagon. He groaned then, and called by name on his beloved companion:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.592">'Be not angry with me, Patroklos, if you discover,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.593">though you be in the house of Hades, that I gave back great Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.24.594">to his loved father, for the ransom he gave me was not unworthy.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.595">I will give you your share of the spoils, as much as is fitting.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.596">So spoke great Achilleus and went back into the shelter</p>
	<p id="IL.24.597">and sat down on the elaborate couch from which he had risen,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.598">against the inward wall, and now spoke his word to Priam:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.599">'Your son is given back to you, aged sir, as you asked it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.600">He lies on a bier. When dawn shows you yourself shall see him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.601">as you take him away. Now you and I must remember our supper.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.602">For even Niobe, she of the lovely tresses, remembered</p>
	<p id="IL.24.603">to eat, whose twelve children were destroyed in her palace,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.604">six daughters, and six sons in the pride of their youth, whom Apollo</p>
	<p id="IL.24.605">killed with arrows from his silver bow, being angered</p>
	<p id="IL.24.606">with Niobe, and shaft-showering Artemis killed the daughters;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.607">because Niobe likened herself to Leto of the fair colouring</p>
	<p id="IL.24.608">and said Leto had borne only two, she herself had borne many;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.609">but the two, though they were only two, destroyed all those others.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.610">Nine days long they lay in their blood, nor was there anyone</p>
	<p id="IL.24.611">to bury them, for the son of Kronos made stones out of</p>
	<p id="IL.24.612">the people; but on the tenth day the Uranian gods buried them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.613">But she remembered to eat when she was worn out with weeping.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.614">And now somewhere among the rocks, in the lonely mountains,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.615">in Sipylos, where they say is the resting place of the goddesses</p>
	<p id="IL.24.616">who are nymphs, and dance beside the waters of Acheloios,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.617">there, stone still, she broods on the sorrows that the gods gave her.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.618">Come then, we also, aged magnificent sir, must remember</p>
	<p id="IL.24.619">to eat, and afterwards you may take your beloved son back</p>
	<p id="IL.24.620">to Ilion, and mourn for him; and he will be much lamented.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.621">So spoke fleet Achilleus and sprang to his feet and slaughtered</p>
	<p id="IL.24.622">a gleaming sheep, and his friends skinned it and butchered it fairly,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.623">and cut up the meat expertly into small pieces, and spitted them,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.624">and roasted all carefully and took off the pieces.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.625">Automedon took the bread and set it out on the table</p>
	<p id="IL.24.626">in fair baskets, while Achilleus served the meats. And thereon</p>
	<p id="IL.24.627">they put their hands to the good things that lay ready before them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.628">But when they had put aside their desire for eating and drinking,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.629">Priam, son of Dardanos, gazed upon Achilleus, wondering</p>
	<p id="IL.24.630">at his size and beauty, for he seemed like an outright vision</p>
	<p id="IL.24.631">of gods. Achilleus in turn gazed on Dardanian Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.24.632">and wondered, as he saw his brave looks and listened to him talking.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.633">But when they had taken their fill of gazing one on the other,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.634">first of the two to speak was the aged man, Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.635">'Give me, beloved of Zeus, a place to sleep presently, so that</p>
	<p id="IL.24.636">we may even go to bed and take the pleasure of sweet sleep.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.637">For my eyes have not closed underneath my lids since that time</p>
	<p id="IL.24.638">when my son lost his life beneath your hands, but always</p>
	<p id="IL.24.639">I have been grieving and brooding over my numberless sorrows</p>
	<p id="IL.24.640">and wallowed in the muck about my courtyard's enclosure.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.641">Now I have tasted food again and have let the gleaming</p>
	<p id="IL.24.642">wine go down my throat. Before, I had tasted nothing.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.643">He spoke, and Achilleus ordered his serving-maids and companions</p>
	<p id="IL.24.644">to make a bed in the porch's shelter and to lay upon it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.645">fine underbedding of purple, and spread blankets above it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.646">and fleecy robes to be an over-all covering. The maid-servants</p>
	<p id="IL.24.647">went forth from the main house, and in their hands held torches,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.648">and set to work, and presently had two beds made. Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.649">of the swift feet now looked at Priam and said, sarcastic:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.650">'Sleep outside, aged sir and good friend, for fear some Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.24.651">might come in here on a matter of counsel, since they keep coming</p>
	<p id="IL.24.652">and sitting by me and making plans; as they are supposed to.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.653">But if one of these come through the fleeting black night should notice you</p>
	<p id="IL.24.654">he would go straight and tell Agamemnon, shepherd of the people,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.655">and there would be delay in the ransoming of the body.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.656">But come, tell me this and count off for me exactly</p>
	<p id="IL.24.657">how many days you intend for the burial of great Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.658">Tell me, so I myself shall stay still and hold back the people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.659">In answer to him again spoke aged Priam the godlike:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.660">'If you are willing that we accomplish a complete funeral</p>
	<p id="IL.24.661">for great Hektor, this, Achilleus, is what you could do and give</p>
	<p id="IL.24.662">me pleasure. For you know surely how we are penned in our city,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.663">and wood is far to bring in from the hills, and the Trojans are frightened</p>
	<p id="IL.24.664">badly. Nine days we would keep him in our palace and mourn him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.665">and bury him on the tenth day, and the people feast by him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.666">and on the eleventh day we would make the grave-barrow for him,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.667">and on the twelfth day fight again; if so we must do.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.668">Then in turn swift-footed brilliant Achilleus answered him:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.669">'Then all this, aged Priam, shall be done as you ask it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.670">I will hold off our attack for as much time as you bid me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.671">So he spoke, and took the aged king by the right hand</p>
	<p id="IL.24.672">at the wrist, so that his heart might have no fear. Then these two,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.673">Priam and the herald who were both men of close counsel,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.674">slept in the place outside the house, in the porch's shelter;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.675">but Achilleus slept in the inward corner of the strong-built shelter,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.676">and at his side lay Briseis of the fair colouring.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.677">Now the rest of the gods and men who were lords of chariots</p>
	<p id="IL.24.678">slept nightlong, with the easy bondage of slumber upon them,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.679">only sleep had not caught Hermes the kind god, who pondered</p>
	<p id="IL.24.680">now in his heart the problem of how to escort King Priam</p>
	<p id="IL.24.681">from the ships and not be seen by the devoted gate-wardens.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.682">He stood above his head and spoke a word to him, saying:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.683">'Aged sir, you can have no thought of evil from the way</p>
	<p id="IL.24.684">you sleep still among your enemies now Achilleus has left you</p>
	<p id="IL.24.685">unharmed. You have ransomed now your dear son and given much for him.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.686">But the sons you left behind would give three times as much ransom</p>
	<p id="IL.24.687">for you, who are alive, were Atreus' son Agamemnon</p>
	<p id="IL.24.688">to recognize you, and all the other Achaians learn of you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.689">He spoke, and the old man was afraid, and wakened his herald,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.690">and lightly Hermes harnessed for them the mules and the horses</p>
	<p id="IL.24.691">and himself drove them through the encampment. And no man knew of them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.692">But when they came to the crossing-place of the fair-running river,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.693">of whirling Xanthos, a stream whose father was Zeus the immortal,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.694">there Hermes left them and went away to the height of Olympos,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.695">and dawn, she of the yellow robe, scattered over all earth,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.696">and they drove their horses on to the city with lamentation</p>
	<p id="IL.24.697">and clamour, while the mules drew the body. Nor was any other</p>
	<p id="IL.24.698">aware of them at the first, no man, no fair-girdled woman,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.699">only Kassandra, a girl like Aphrodite the golden,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.700">who had gone up to the height of the Pergamos. She saw</p>
	<p id="IL.24.701">her dear father standing in the chariot, his herald and crier</p>
	<p id="IL.24.702">with him. She saw Hektor drawn by the mules on a litter.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.703">She cried out then in sorrow and spoke to the entire city:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.704">'Come, men of Troy and Trojan women; look upon Hektor</p>
	<p id="IL.24.705">if ever before you were joyful when you saw him come back living</p>
	<p id="IL.24.706">from battle; for he was a great joy to his city, and all his people.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.707">She spoke, and there was no man left there in all the city</p>
	<p id="IL.24.708">nor woman, but all were held in sorrow passing endurance.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.709">They met Priam beside the gates as he brought the dead in.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.710">First among them were Hektor's wife and his honoured mother</p>
	<p id="IL.24.711">who tore their hair, and ran up beside the smooth-rolling wagon,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.712">and touched his head. And the multitude, wailing, stood there about them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.713">And now and there in front of the gates they would have lamented</p>
	<p id="IL.24.714">all day till the sun went down and let fall their tears for Hektor,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.715">except that the old man spoke from the chariot to his people:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.716">'Give me way to get through with my mules; then afterwards</p>
	<p id="IL.24.717">you may sate yourselves with mourning, when I have him inside the palace.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.718">So he spoke, and they stood apart and made way for the wagon.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.719">And when they had brought him inside the renowned house, they laid him</p>
	<p id="IL.24.720">then on a carved bed, and seated beside him the singers</p>
	<p id="IL.24.721">who were to lead the melody in the dirge, and the singers</p>
	<p id="IL.24.722">chanted the song of sorrow, and the women were mourning beside them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.723">Andromache of the white arms led the lamentation</p>
	<p id="IL.24.724">of the women, and held in her arms the head of manslaughtering Hektor:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.725">'My husband, you were lost young from life, and have left me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.726">a widow in your house, and the boy is only a baby</p>
	<p id="IL.24.727">who was born to you and me, the unhappy. I think he will never</p>
	<p id="IL.24.728">come of age, for before then head to heel this city</p>
	<p id="IL.24.729">will be sacked, for you, its defender, are gone, you who guarded</p>
	<p id="IL.24.730">the city, and the grave wives, and the innocent children,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.731">wives who before long must go away in the hollow ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.732">and among them I shall also go, and you, my child, follow</p>
	<p id="IL.24.733">where I go, and there do much hard work that is unworthy</p>
	<p id="IL.24.734">of you, drudgery for a hard master; or else some Achaian</p>
	<p id="IL.24.735">will take you by hand and hurl you from the tower into horrible</p>
	<p id="IL.24.736">death, in anger because Hektor once killed his brother,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.737">or his father, or his son; there were so many Achaians</p>
	<p id="IL.24.738">whose teeth bit the vast earth, beaten down by the hands of Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.739">Your father was no merciful man in the horror of battle.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.740">Therefore your people are grieving for you all through their city,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.741">Hektor, and you left for your parents mourning and sorrow</p>
	<p id="IL.24.742">beyond words, but for me passing all others is left the bitterness</p>
	<p id="IL.24.743">and the pain, for you did not die in bed, and stretch your arms to me,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.744">nor tell me some last intimate word that I could remember</p>
	<p id="IL.24.745">always, all the nights and days of my weeping for you.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.746">So she spoke in tears, and the women were mourning about her.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.747">Now Hekabe led out the thronging chant of their sorrow:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.748">'Hektor, of all my sons the dearest by far to my spirit;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.749">while you still lived for me you were dear to the gods, and even</p>
	<p id="IL.24.750">in the stage of death they cared about you still. There were others</p>
	<p id="IL.24.751">of my sons whom at times swift-footed Achilleus captured,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.752">and he would sell them as slaves far across the unresting salt water</p>
	<p id="IL.24.753">into Samos, and Imbros, and Lemnos in the gloom of the mists. You,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.754">when he had taken your life with the thin edge of the bronze sword,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.755">he dragged again and again around his beloved companion's</p>
	<p id="IL.24.756">tomb, Patroklos', whom you killed, but even so did not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.757">bring him back to life. Now you lie in the palace, handsome</p>
	<p id="IL.24.758">and fresh with dew, in the likeness of one whom he of the silver</p>
	<p id="IL.24.759">bow, Apollo, has attacked and killed with his gentle arrows.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.760">So she spoke, in tears, and wakened the endless mourning.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.761">Third and last Helen led the song of sorrow among them:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.762">'Hektor, of all my lord's brothers dearest by far to my spirit:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.763">my husband is Alexandros, like an immortal, who brought me</p>
	<p id="IL.24.764">here to Troy; and I should have died before I came with him;</p>
	<p id="IL.24.765">and here now is the twentieth year upon me since I came</p>
	<p id="IL.24.766">from the place where I was, forsaking the land of my fathers. In this time</p>
	<p id="IL.24.767">I have never heard a harsh saying from you, nor an insult.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.768">No, but when another, one of my lord's brothers or sisters, a fair-robed</p>
	<p id="IL.24.769">wife of some brother, would say a harsh word to me in the palace,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.770">or my lord's mother--but his father was gentle always, a father</p>
	<p id="IL.24.771">indeed--then you would speak and put them off and restrain them</p>
	<p id="IL.24.772">by your own gentleness of heart and your gentle words. Therefore</p>
	<p id="IL.24.773">I mourn for you in sorrow of heart and mourn myself also</p>
	<p id="IL.24.774">and my ill luck. There was no other in all the wide Troad</p>
	<p id="IL.24.775">who was kind to me, and my friend; all others shrank when they saw me.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.776">So she spoke in tears, and the vast populace grieved with her.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.777">Now Priam the aged king spoke forth his word to his people:</p>
	<p id="IL.24.778">'Now, men of Troy, bring timber into the city, and let not</p>
	<p id="IL.24.779">your hearts fear a close ambush of the Argives. Achilleus</p>
	<p id="IL.24.780">promised me, as he sent me on my way from the black ships,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.781">that none should do us injury until the twelfth dawn comes.'</p>
	<p id="IL.24.782">He spoke, and they harnessed to the wagons their mules and their oxen</p>
	<p id="IL.24.783">and presently were gathered in front of the city. Nine days</p>
	<p id="IL.24.784">they spent bringing in an endless supply of timber. But when</p>
	<p id="IL.24.785">the tenth dawn had shone forth with her light upon mortals,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.786">they carried out bold Hektor, weeping, and set the body</p>
	<p id="IL.24.787">aloft a towering pyre for burning. And set fire to it.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.788">But when the young dawn showed again with her rosy fingers,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.789">the people gathered around the pyre of illustrious Hektor.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.790">But when all were gathered to one place and assembled together,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.791">first with gleaming wine they put out the pyre that was burning,</p>
	<p id="IL.24.792">all where the fury of the fire still was in force, and thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.24.793">the brothers and companions of Hektor gathered the white bones</p>
	<p id="IL.24.794">up, mourning, as the tears swelled and ran down their cheeks. Then</p>
	<p id="IL.24.795">they laid what they had gathered up in a golden casket</p>
	<p id="IL.24.796">and wrapped this about with soft robes of purple, and presently</p>
	<p id="IL.24.797">put it away in the hollow of the grave, and over it</p>
	<p id="IL.24.798">piled huge stones laid close together. Lightly and quickly</p>
	<p id="IL.24.799">they piled up the grave-barrow, and on all sides were set watchmen</p>
	<p id="IL.24.800">for fear the strong-greaved Achaians might too soon set upon them.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.801">They piled up the grave-barrow and went away, and thereafter</p>
	<p id="IL.24.802">assembled in a fair gathering and held a glorious</p>
	<p id="IL.24.803">feast within the house of Priam, king under God's hand.</p>
	<p id="IL.24.804">Such was their burial of Hektor, breaker of horses.</p>
